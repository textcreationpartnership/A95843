            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though God hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his true worſhip to us, yet Satan hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more by ſuperſtition, then the Spirit of God by true Religion. All Ages can beare witneſſe to this truth. When God imployed the divine Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> in a meſſage to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he armed him with the power of Miracles, but <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> reſiſted him, and that with ſuch eagerneſſe, that for a while, they prevailed more with their falſe exorciſmes, than hee did with his true Miracles. <hi>Solomon</hi> built and dedicated the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n <hi>Jeroboam</hi> a private man ſet up his Idols in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> with ſuch ſucceſſe, that hee withdrew ten Tribes to his Idolatry. How violent was <hi>Jezabel, Ahabs</hi> wife, in the ſuperſtitious maintaining of <hi>Paal,</hi> that not onely did ſhe extinguiſh both the people and worſhip of God, but alſo ſo terrified <hi>Elijah,</hi> who could procure fire from heaven, that he was forced to leave his ſtation, and in his exile to wiſh
<pb facs="tcp:114151:3"/>for death, whom notwithſtanding God had purpoſed to honour, by carrying him up to heaven in a fiery chariot. There is nothing more plaine, then that <hi>they who wickedly in ice</hi> men to ſuperſtition, <hi>are for the moſt part, more active</hi> and ſucceſſefull <hi>then thoſe who are the builders up of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bad ſucceſſe in Religion proceeds from the multitude themſelves, whoſe property it is to be led rather by opinion, then by knowledge, and to give their aſſent before they make triall, although <hi>envious men</hi> dia not ſow <hi>tares</hi> in the night, yet the earth would produce thornes by reaſon of the ancient curſe: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were no inventers or teachers of ſuperſtition, yet the vaine multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would deviſe to it ſelfe ſome ſuperſtitious worſhip. This calamity proceeds not from the want of truth, but from Gods juſt judgements: For as <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne hath made the earth more apt to produce of its own accord <hi>tares,</hi> then all the induſtry of man can, to bring forth good fruite: Even ſo the old <hi>Serpent</hi> is more prevalent in bewitching mens mindes with ſuperſtition, then the fellow labourers of the Holy Ghoſt, in propagating the true Religion.</p>
            <p>There was never any Age or Country of the world, which hath not had ſome time experience of this. Yet this was never more plainly ſeen then under the great Antichriſt whom <hi>Paul</hi> foretold ſhould bee armed with all deceiveableneſſe,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.</note> that he might intice ſuch to beleeve lies, that were careleſſe to beleeve the truth. Never was there any ſince the creation more guilty of this then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who whilſt hee obtrudes upon the people a hodge-podge of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, prevailes more with them then the Prophets and Apoſtles, by their true Religion, and Miracles. For theſe (even <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe
<note n="*" place="margin">And the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note>) could doe no more but undergoe torments and ignominy, and at laſt lay down their tortured lives, but he on the other ſide, being armed with ſuperſtition, and pretending <hi>Peters</hi> name and chaire, mounted up to ſuch a height, that being honoured with three Crownes, two ſwords, and the ſpoyles of all Princes, he exalts himſelfe above all worldly Potentates, and all ſuch as are called Gods, ſitting in the Temple of God, and pretending the Church, doth ſo bewitch men, that hee whom they ſee, call, and cry out, to bee wicked, a lyar, a falſifyer, doe notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him to hee the patron and judge of Religion. Such is the force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, ariſing from ſuperſtition, that men ſee not what they ſee, and beleeve they ſee what they ſee not, as if they were inchanted. Hence it is not to bee wondred at that the whole company of ſuch cheaters, arme themſelves with their own ſuperſtition, when they have a minde to deceive; which like poyſon as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invades mens mindes, and taints them, as a tauny colour doth thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a while in the Sunne, which inſenſibly and ſuddenly comes upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew it came.</p>
            <p>This corruption is not to be found, onely in popery, but among Proteſtants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:114151:3"/>whoſe mindes being puffed up with the deſire of ruling, and counting the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Apoſtolicall Church ſordid, they will rather rule then obey: So that they place the ſanctity of Religion not in Gods Word, not in Faith, nor in the profeſſion thereof, nor in any other reall worſhip, but in the right and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of handling theſe things, ſo that not onely in their Theſes, but in full Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes they declaime for the ſanctity of government, perſwading the people with all the might they can, that the whole dreſſing of Church government at this day, is of ſuch ſpiritualitie, that the politicall Magiſtrate, as being carnall, muſt bee totally ſeparated from it. Hence may Miniſters with eaſe hereafter withdraw their necks in Church-affaires from the power of the Magiſtrate, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly inſult over, and preſcribe Laws to the ſecular powers.</p>
            <p>This new guiſe of Popery our famous <hi>Vaedelius</hi> foreſeeing, did publiſh a Book concerning <hi>The Epiſcopacy of Conſtantine the Great,</hi> in which hee hath written of the right of Magiſtrates in Church-affaires at this day, but with ſuch circumſpection, that no moderate man can be moved, much leſſe angred thereat, for hee feared (as he intimated in his Preface) leſt the reſtleſſe minds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Church-men ſhould be incenſed, and now it was ſuppoſed that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred their diſpleaſure, but the book being in every mans hand, and approved by the teſtimony of D. <hi>Macovius</hi> and <hi>Rivet,</hi> it ſeemed to bee out of all danger of malice.</p>
            <p>But the caſe was ſuddenly altered; and our <hi>Vedelius</hi> was moleſted, not by neighbours, but by tranſmarin ſtrangers from <hi>Zeland.</hi> For one <hi>William Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> did not onely ſpit in his face, but alſo piſſe in his aſhes.

            <p>Hee hath adorned his work with a ſpecious title, to wit, <hi>The Right of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in holy things:</hi> as if hee were about to fight for the honour of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, whereas he upbraides them every where in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that oftentimes hee makes ſecular powers, guilty of ſacriledge, and of trampling upon the blood of Chriſt, if they offer to meddle with Eccleſiaſtick affaires, beſides what hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:114151:4"/>preſcribed. Now leaſt this <hi>Walachrian</hi> ſhould without controle write what hee pleaſeth,
<note place="margin">Philarchiae pruriginem.</note> againſt our famous <hi>Vedelius,</hi> and all godly Magiſtrates: I thought good to ſcratch with my pen, his itching deſire of ruling: It is the part of your Highneſſe to ſuppreſſe by your Authority this ſcab, that it may not ſpread too farre. I confeſſe I have in ſome places pulled him by the eares, ſomewhat roughly, but yet more modeſtly then hee deſerved; being no wayes deſirous to wreſtle with the ſhaddow of learning, but as they are wont to doe, who have the keeping of Lions, they beat a Dogge, that the Lion may be afraid; ſo I thought good to beat this curre, that I might keep the Lions whelps within their dens, or grates. Who would roare aloud other wayes, but now whiſper onely in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. As ſure as the Sun ſhines, this <hi>Walachrian</hi> device is borrowed from Popery, and Printed to this intent, that in <hi>Walachria,</hi> or at leaſt in <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Apollonius</hi> alone, with a few Claſſick Elders and aſſiſtants, might rule the roſt. I ſpeak not heare out of partiality; for this <hi>VVilliam Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is not known to mee, either by benefits or injuries, let every man beleeve or not beleeve as hee pleaſeth; my purpoſe is no other, then to make the device of this <hi>Apollonian</hi> Church ſanctity, abſurd and ridiculous, for it is not onely as like Popery as a Doves egge is like a Hens egg, but alſo it intendeth the ſame end, ſo that what the Pope doth openly and directly in challenging power over all ſecular Princes, this man by an indirect way, and cunning <hi>circuition,</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over his Magiſtrates, and would make tryall of it, if occaſion ſerved; the truth of both which, if I ſhould in a ſhort abridgement ſet down, I hope it ſhal not trouble you to run over, though perhaps your more ſerious imployments may deny you leaſure to read the reſt.</p>
            <p>That old leven of Popery concerning the wonderfull ſanctity and ſpirituality of the externall Miniſtery of the viſible Church, hath been trampled upon by all Orthodox men. This the Pope, the fatall enemy of Chriſt, and the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt hath ſo dreſſed and poliſhed, that hee hath perſwaded the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that all Clergie-imployment is ſacred and ſpirituall, and that the Clergie themſelves, are all ſpirituall and holy, Whence men were poſſeſſed with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious conceit, that it was neither lawfull nor poſſible for Lay-men to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with Eccleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That this game was borrowed from the ceremonies of the Jewiſh Synagogue, and Gentiliſme, is apparent even to Papiſts themſelves, if they are not blinde, but whoſoever are converſant among the Romiſh Clergie, will finde that this <hi>(ſpirituall character)</hi> is of ſuch <hi>efficacy,</hi> that for it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

This is moſt clearely ſeen in the election and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Popes. For not without divine appointment, did the Pope preferre himſelfe to all Monarchs by this pretext of ſpirituality. Hence aroſe the fatall pride
<note n="*" place="margin">Typhus.</note> of that ſeat and Biſhop, in preferring himſelfe, and his chaire in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before all others, and chiefly in ſubſtracting from the Civill Magiſtrate, and arrogating to himſelfe the right of his Vocation, as it were by an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled and divine priviledge. This arrogancy was foreſeen by thoſe excellent Emperours, <hi>Juſtinian, Mauritius, Lodovicus Pius,</hi> the <hi>Otho's,</hi>

<note place="margin">In vita Greg. 7</note> from this proceeded afterward the ſeparation of Church-men from other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as Laicks, which exempted them at firſt from the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Civill Magiſtrate, in Eccleſiaſticall buſineſſe. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Eccleſiaſtick Courts of Juſtice, which being one Empire within another; and a Kingdome within a Kingdome, it could not bee avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that theſe two powers and juriſdictions muſt needs daſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, to wit, the Eccleſiaſtick and Civill, and this fell out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with ſuch eager contention, that the Chriſtian world trembled at it, but by Antichriſts fatall obſtinacy, the Eccleſiaſtick Government in this ſtrugling, obtained the Victory. That now the Pope being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his two ſwords, and three Crownes, he ſleights the Scepters of all Emperours and Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the type of Popery, to which as an antitype anſwers <hi>Apollonius</hi> his <hi>Walachrian</hi> government, for with him nothing is more ancient, then to extoll the outward buſineſſe of the Eccleſiaſtick Miniſtery, for holy, ſpirituall, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine among men.

For theſe are <hi>preaching, and publick Prayer, the outward adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the making of Laws, for the outward order of the Church; the greater and leſſer cenſure, whereof this is, by ſuſpending from the Lords Supper, that by ſeparation from the whole body of the Church, by the uttering of certain words: Laſtly, Election, and confirmation to Eccleſiaſtick Offices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which affaires at this day are known, to be performed by ordinary gifts, oftentimes in a humane and perverſe way, even by ſuch who being void of all Chriſtian vertues, are laden with nothing elſe, but wickedneſſe: that <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> may obtrude ſuperſtition after a Popiſh manner, when hee ſearcheth after ſuch abſtruce myſteries of ſpirituality, in the outward works of Eccleſiaſtick dreſſing, that hee might make men think that what is performed by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall function of the Church, is of a higher nature then mans capacity can reach unto, Whereas the whole dignity of theſe things (as they are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this day) depends from Chriſts generall institution, and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Order.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe lurking places, being driven after the Popiſh manner he flies to <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Vocation, and chiefly to confirmation by impoſing of hands,</hi> which though at this day it be defiled and variouſly ſpotted, ſhewing no effects of ſpirituallity in thoſe on whom it is conferred. Yet hee would faine perſwade us that it is of wonderfull efficacy, for conferring of ſpirituall right, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prerogative, to performe the ſacred Offices of the Church, that it hath ſuch a ſpeciall prerogative, ſo that hee accounts him

               <hi>Becauſe they are ſo different in the ſubject, end, and meanes, that he thinks heaven and earth will be confounded</hi> if the Magistrate ſhould offer to touch the internall things of the Church, For hee will not allow the ſecular power to bee in, but onely <hi>about the Church,</hi> which medleth with the circumstantialls, of the Church, onely as a <hi>ſeparable accident,</hi> which the Church may eaſily want, and did want un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles, and time of the firſt Reformation. So that as hee aſſevers, the Chriſtian and godly Magistrate, hath no more to doe with Church-affaires, then the wicked hath, in reſpect of right, except in caſes extraordinary, when the whole Clergie wants reformation, but yet on this condition too, that the judgement of this matter bee left to the Church-men: But if the Magiſtrate ſhould meddle with any thing which hee calls formally Eccleſiaſtick, beſides theſe caſes, hee cryes out openly, that ſacriledge and robbery is committed; that the rights of Chriſts Spouſe are violated, for which Chriſt ſhed his blood; yea that the ſtate of the Church was happier under the croſſe, becauſe of her free juriſdiction which then ſhee uſed, then now if the Magiſtrate offer to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the Church-affaires, ſo that indeed hee counts, no better then <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> the religious Magistrates, who were not to ſerve in, but <hi>about</hi> the Sanctuary, and were not to meddle with, or touch any holy thing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tide to ſervile obedience in furniſhing neceſſaries, were bound perpetually to acknowledge their fraud and prophaneneſſe.</p>
            <p>Out of ſo many naughty rootes of Popery, it is no wonder if in <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and ſome of his followers; this fruite proceed, not onely in ſpeaking evill of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rulers, as often as they ſeeme to Clergie-men, to ſtumble upon the rights of the Church, but contrarily, they dare in ſecular affaires, preſcribe to, and command the Magistrate, by their Paſtorall authority; ſo that no <hi>Catechiſme</hi> ſeemes to them more holy, than that they aſſure one another, that the ſecular Magistrate, is ſimply to bee debarred from all things which they account Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and that they are not to be admitted into the meaneſt part of their modern Eccleſiaſtick ſpirituality, <hi>(ſo faire as they performe the Office of a Magiſtrate)</hi> the top of which ſpirituallity, if elſewhere they ſeem to touch, that they muſt bee reſiſted with might and maine, as profane men, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or, if ſtrength bee wanting, indirectly, and cunningly,
<note place="margin">Per cuniculos.</note> in their private or publick declamations to the people. Sure <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſeemes in this work to ſound the Alarum, and by his example to ſtirre up turbulent Miniſters, to bee bold upon the Magiſtrate, when opportunity ſerves, and to ſhake off one time or other, their <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>violent,</hi> yoke. I doubt not but ſuch kinde of vermine

            <p>I will no more propheſie, but now will produce the acts of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and his fellow Walachrians, ſet out not a few years ſince; which will teach us, that long agoe they were reſolved, and purpoſed firſt to preſcribe a Law to the Civill Magistrate in Eccleſiaſtick buſineſſe, and then afterward in ſecular, and to leave no ſtone unmoved for weakning and ſhaking of their authority.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince,
<note place="margin">1 Example.</note> when the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Parliament were warring, the Vicinity of places, and the Commerce of Religion, from that diſturbed State, ſpread complaints among the people, which indirectly (as uſually) ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to require pity and helpe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apollonius</hi> with his fellows now a long time deſirous of innovation, and whileſt other Churches were quiet, did ſtudy to interpoſe himſelfe in theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that hee might bee known to the Engliſh, and prevailed ſo much by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Arts with the Walachrians, that among others he obtained the charge of comforting the Church there by Letters, and offering to them verball conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>This being known, the States of <hi>Zeland</hi> thinking with themſelves, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it might bee, if the Miniſters of <hi>Zeland,</hi> ſhould intermeddle with the affaires of <hi>England</hi> without their advice, conſidering that not onely the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences waxed hot between the King and Parliament, but between the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men themſelves, ſo that ſome affected this, others, that kinde of Church-Government.

            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Triall which they made of their Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction,
<note place="margin">2 Example.</note> there fell out another not unlike this: The continuance of the unhappy Warre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great famine amongst the Iriſh, that not onely by report, but alſo by inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Parliament, it was divulged that thouſands of Iriſh were like to be ſtarved, if they were not releeved the ſooner, this matter being firſt brought to the States Generall in the name of the Parliament, and by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to their Provinces: by the States of <hi>Zeland,</hi> Order was alſo taken in their publick meetings, that releefe ſhould bee raiſed in all the Townes and Villages, within their precincts; adding an expreſſe command, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould bee brought to the Table of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> as to the common Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, that with more certainty and expedition, aide might bee ſent from the States Commiſſioners, to thoſe miſerable and panting people. Here <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> with his Complices, perceiving that by this meanes the diſtribution of the Money ſhould bee taken away from the Churches juriſdiction and his power, they did not now tacitly whiſper, but openly cry out, that they would not obey the States Order, but the Magiſtrates of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> being unwilling to give way to this diſobedience and rebellion of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and being alſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the quarrell raiſed afore by him and his fellows, about the collection and diſtribution of the money of <hi>Sweibrugh,</hi> where they challenged all that right as ſacred, and proper onely to the Church: Fearing alſo leſt by theſe and ſuch like Remora's, the ready and needfull benevolence that was raiſed, ſhould bee retarded; they no leſſe piouſly then prudently, ordered to gather from houſe to houſe, neither was this a thing unuſuall in that City; where foure times in the yeare, certain deputed Magiſtrates together with the Deacons, uſe to gather mens benevolence from houſe to houſe, for the releefe of the poore. Here <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> with his Church-men made oppoſition, plainly threatning, that bee would not recommend the diſtreſſed: ſtate of the Iriſh for any releefe from the members of the Church, as the cuſtome was: whiſpering that it were better, there never were any Almes gathered, than that ſo holy a work of mercy ſhould in ſuch an unlawfull way be profained by the Magiſtrate. Willing alſo to ſhew his boldneſſe in maintaining the ſanctity of his juriſdiction, the matter being agitate in the Conſiſtory, he drew it to the Walachrian Claſſis, by whoſe ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being aſſiſted, by a large writing, hee ſignified to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh,</hi> they ſhould doe <hi>againſt the Scriptures, the cuſtome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the modern right of the Church, againſt the confeſſions, and as it
<pb facs="tcp:114151:7"/>were the very Nationall Oath, and conſequently to the prejudice of the whole Religion.</hi> If they preſumed to touch with their ſecular and prophane hands, ſo ſacred a buſineſſe, as the collecting and diſtributing of Almes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that this holy work was injoyned by holy men, that is, by the Church, for holy men, and therefore could not bee lawfully exerciſed but by holy Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Which childiſh ſongs, though elſewhere. I did ſleight with laughter, yet <hi>Apollonius</hi> made ſuch account of them, that hee plainely affirmed in the fourth Article of his paper, which hee exhibited, that the ordering and diſpoſing of collections or almes, <hi>appertain to the Church, and that they depend upon no power out of the Church,</hi> if this bee ſo, then the ſecular Magiſtrate hath now no more right to appoint Collections, among his ſubjects, whereof the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part are the Churches within their juriſdictions. For becauſe the power of the Magiſtrate is not in, but (about) the Church (as <hi>Apollonius</hi> finely ſings elſewhere) by this ſuppoſition, the Magiſtrate hath no power to impoſe any tax upon the holy people of the Church, for an holy uſe, for this were prophanation: but this right belongs to the Church onely, that is, to the Miniſters, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. And ſo if <hi>Apollonius</hi> by his divinity can make this good, it will follow that no member of the Church can bee ſure what is his own, and that the Prince hath no more power over his Subjects, then the Miniſters of the Church, over the Members of Chriſt: the chiefe power of the Civill Magiſtrate conſiſteth in impoſing of Taxes on his Subjects; but if Preachers may in the Church have ſuch Arbitrary power, as hath no dependence on the Civill Magistate; who doth not ſee a gate opened for Church-Governours not onely of abſolute Ruling, but alſo of inriching themſelves, after the manner of the Popes; for whatſoever they by meanes of long gentleneſſe of Princes, have ſcraped together, by their indulgences, donations, reſervations, annates, and ſuch like inventions, all theſe at this day muſt the Miniſters obtain, under pretence of ſpirituall almes. <hi>Apollonius</hi> was not content to declare this in words, but hee muſt alſo in the triall thereof in deeds, For the Walachrian Claſſes, confiding to <hi>Apollonius</hi> his ſeeming reaſons, did ſignifie to the Deacons according to their Authority, <hi>that they ſhould not afford their help to the Magiſtrate, nor any way ſerve them in theſe kindes of collections</hi>) neither did they this in private, but openly by their Letters, they ſignified ſo much to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh, 24</hi> of <hi>Decemb. 1643.</hi> which were ſubſcribed in the name of the Conſiſtory, by <hi>Jacob Anſelaer, William Apollonius, Peter Velde, Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bakelier.</hi> The roome of the Claſſes was filled up by <hi>S. Van Denyſe, Iſaac Horenbek, J. Vanden Brande,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Ulyſſing,</hi> who by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did ſhew, that hee had yeelded blinde obedience to <hi>Apollonius;</hi> becauſe hee made no ſcruple to give this Law to the Magistrate of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (and
<pb facs="tcp:114151:7"/>that in Chriſts right) from which hee knew the Magiſtrates of his own Town were free, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Ulyſſing</hi> collected from doore to doore, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his own Town being neither conſulted with, nor making reſiſtance, ſo it appeares that by the ſole inſtigation of <hi>Apollonius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cuſa eſt faba.</note> becauſe of his hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Magistrates, this trouble was laid upon the Governours of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh:</hi> The event of this ſedition was, that the prudent Magistrates of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> willing to yeeld to thoſe times, ſuppreſſing their anger, gave way that the Miniſters ſhould make their Collections in the Church: but firſt ſwearing that all the money collected, ſhould according to the States order, be brought to the Table. Howſoever this was done by <hi>Apollonius,</hi> yet it is moſt certain, that multitudes of Iriſh, were undone and periſhed, by reaſon of the hinderance cauſed by this contention. For although it was in every mans mouth, and oftentimes inculcated by the Miniſters themſelves, that many Iriſh would bee ruined and ſtarved, if they were not the ſooner ſupplyed, yet with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> and the new Zelots, a needleſſe ſtrife about a ſmall point of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Right, did more prevaile, then the ruine and death of ſo many good men for want of neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>Out of this fruitefull Garden of contentions about <hi>Apollonius his ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

            <p>Now for a long time the Magistrate had permitted <hi>the uſe of Organs in the Church,</hi> to regulate the incompoſed and confuſed ſinging of Pſalmes; being an ancient inſtitution, and never diſliked by the Miniſters that were <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>The ſecular Magistrates at that time did waver, for diverſe cauſes, namely the cloſe plottings of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and his complices, ſtriving what they could to remove from the helme of Government, all ſuch as did not flatter <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his pride; and that they onely ſhould ſit at the ſtern, whom either neere acquaintance, or their ſecret favour to Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, had indeered to <hi>Apollonius</hi> but this combination and ſpecious conſpiracy was happily and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently broke, by thoſe who were then the chiefe Governours, in removing from publick employment ſome, upon juſt grounds, and placeing others in their roome; yet doing nothing that might infringe their Priviledges.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates being then wholly taken up with ſuites, agitate in the Courts of Juſtice, and not able to put an end to ſo many ſuites in Law. They according to their own deſire, and of thoſe who had ſuites depending, taking a pattern from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and other Townes, that they might bee eaſed of the trouble of <hi>ſmall</hi> ſuites, appointed a <hi>Court of ſmall buſineſſe,</hi> as they call it, where every man may plead in his own caſe, without the helpe of Lawyers. When the Conſulls did oftentimes in private conſult (as the cuſtome is there) about theſe matters,
<pb facs="tcp:114151:8"/>and not calling into their conſultations thoſe prime men of the Town, whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonus</hi> favoured, be being incenſed, that Civill affaires were not carryed, as hee would have them, did utter invectives daily out of his Pulpit againſt the Town Governours: whoſe violent carriage, when hee ſaw was ſtoutly ſlighted by them, hee drew all his colleagues to joyne with him in his boldneſſe, theſe having got opportunity to ſpeak with the Town Governours, hee did to their face grievouſly reprove them, objecting divers things, and ſawcily carping at them, that the poynts of their accuſation increaſed to the number of foureteen, ſome of which are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. That being ſo often warned of removing the Organs out of the Church, they had not hitherto obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. That they uſed private Conventicles in their conſultations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3, That they had removed from the Helme of Government, able men, placing unfit men in their toome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. That they had erected New Tribunalls to the end that having found out wayes of profit, by their new Offices, they ſhould ingratiate to them ſome Towneſmen, to the violation of their Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, That they were enemies to the Church, and by their actions ſhewed, they favoured Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which fault, I thinke the Magistrates of that Town, are as free as any elſe-where. For it is known that not once, the Conſulls themſelves miſtruſting the gentleneſſe of the Sheriffe, or Chiefe Juſtice, have entred into Popiſh aſſemblies, and carryed away all their Maſſe furniture, or trumpery: teaching by their example, all other Magiſtrates, to ſuppreſſe theſe ſuperſtitious kinde of people. Theſe and other things, which the Miniſters by <hi>Apollonius,</hi> his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upbraided the Magistrates with, to their faces, were by them born with, as was fitting, gravely and wiſely. Yet having taken notes of the chiefe heads of their accuſation, by their penſionary, they exhorted the Miniſters to peace and moderation, uſing then onely verball reproofe, although they knew <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and ſome others to be bold incendiaries. But they reſerved ſharper repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions till occaſion ſhould ſerve: Many things might bee ſaid of this nature: but <hi>Apollonius</hi> never left off to hunt after ſome high preferment in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> which at home amongst the Middleburgians hee could not procure that might give him content, by reaſon the Magiſtrates did ſo croſſe him: to whom when he knew that all his miſchievous plots were manifeſt, and deſpairing of Victory, yet hee gave not off with old dying <hi>Priamus,</hi> to fling weake darts that could not hurt, catching at every opportunity, which hee thought might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly or indirectly hinder the Churches Peace, or the Magiſtrates eſteem, and that not privately but openly, entertaining and hugging ſuch occaſions, as I will ſhew by one example more.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114151:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonard Cepeſteyn,</hi> one of the dregges of Lawyers,
<note place="margin">5 Example.</note> did for a long time gape at the Government of that Common-wealth; but being ſtill fruſtrated, and irritated with vaine and long expectation, hee was obſerved for a great while, to beare no good will to the Magiſtrates, it fell out that one <hi>Lumirius</hi> a Knave was found guilty of Treaſon, who having counterfeit himſelf a foole, did firſt eſcape the rack, and afterward chaines, and death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonard</hi> undertook (as they ſay) the defence of this fellow, partly in hope of booty, partly, out of deſire to raile; which hee did ſo impudently, that in open Court hee upbraided the Magistrate with ignorance and injuſtice, ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if hee would have ſtirred up the multitude (which then had filled the Town-Hall, to heare this new pleading) againſt the Magistrate. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> being moved at this bold and impudent act, did a long time reſolve to baniſh this ſeditious man. Yet their revenge went not farther then this; to wit, that by their Order this <hi>Leonard</hi> was forbid to meddle with pleading of any more Cauſes, either by word or writ; being deſirous rather to give, then to cut off an occaſion of repentance. Yet notwithſtanding hee being helped by the cunning of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his ſpirituality, ceaſed not to ſearch out all the occaſions hee could to bee revenged on the Magistrates, at laſt hee found out a notable one, by <hi>Apollonius</hi> his helpe, who was able to ſhake it out of his private Divinity budgets, to wit, that this turbulent man, being debarred from publick pleading, or ſitting among the Lawyers, in open Courts, for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and wrongs offered by him to the Magistrate, from which publick ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall hee was not cleared, might bee admitted among the Elders. And truely ſo farre did this <hi>Cepeſteyn</hi> prevaile by <hi>Apollonius</hi> his tricks, and favour, that hee was choſen an Elder of the Church;
<note n="*" place="margin">He was ſo bad that he was not fit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the State, yet good enough to be employed in the Church, &amp;c.</note> not that hee might by any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him, be uſefull to the Church, but that <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Presbytery might upbraid the Magiſtrate with injustice, for ſtopping his mouth from pleading, whom they thought fit ſhould bee an Elder.</p>
            <p>But chiefly that the Lawyer might take an occaſion to revenge himſelfe, and wrong all ſecular Magiſtrates, at leaſt indirectly, from the Eccleſiaſtick tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, I write this onely by relation, but I doubt not the truth of it. For hee that will ſearch the States Ordinances there, and the Records or Regiſter of the Magistrates of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> will finde, that I am not further off from Truth, then from Reaſon, which doth manifeſtly ſhew, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> for a long time with his Walachrians, have been ſtriving, in thought, word, and deed, by their example, to teach other ſpirituall men of the like ſtamp, to reſiſt Magistrates and Princes; and that Pope-like under pretence of the Church-Hierarchie, they would diſſolve, and ſubject to themſelves, the carnall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſecular powers.

They contained themſelves within the preſcript of the Law, nor could theſe things bee thruſt upon them as ſacred, and not to bee touched, which God had not by an expreſſe Law ſeparated. The old Leviticall and templar ſeparation is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and yet this new Walachrian Levite, perverſely imitating the Jews, challengeth in his Church-dreſſings, that for holy and untangible, which the old Levites themſelves, if they were alive, would not debarre you from. For it had been a moſt unworthy act to keepe off the High-Prieſt from medling elſe-where with holy things, who might lawfully enter into the Holy of Holies; this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge being granted, there could bee nothing ſo ſacred, which bee might not touch: How great then is the wrong which theſe new Prieſts offer to you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of holineſſe, when they would affright You from medling with the
<pb facs="tcp:114151:10"/>Modern outward affaires of the Church, Who have received from God a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall power to enter every day into the now Chriſtian Holy of Holyes, There is now nothing in the Church, nor in the whole world, ſo ſacred and infallible as the holy Scripture. This is our Holy of Holies, this is our Propitiatory, Arke, and Cherubim; this is our Breſt-plate, ſhining with farre more brighter jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, then that of the Jews; This is our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim: and whatſoever of old was venerable amongst the Jewes, but now loſt, comes farre ſhort of this which ſhall never periſh, though Heaven it ſelfe ſhould fall. In this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matter of ſalvation, God doth anſwer You as well as the Prieſts, whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is ſtill certain and infallible: Now whereas God himſelfe by ſpeciall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant permits, nay commands You to enter into this; what madneſſe is it, that from the petty ſacred things of this Church-furniture, You ſhould bee kept off, from touching them, under pretence of ſanctity: This is our Chriſtian Liberty and felicity, that wee are all now under Chriſt, Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets. That the generall priviledge of Chriſtians is ſo large, that no man is excluded from the adminiſtration of ſacred things at this day, if hee bee gifted.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe it ſtands not with decency and Order, that any man without calling ſhould put his hand to the Modern Miniſtery, yet the holineſſe of the function is not hereby violated, the Calling is at this day humane, and oftentimes corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſerves for Order, but conferres nothing to ſpeciall ſanctity. Our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern impoſition of hands, doth imitate the fact, not the effect of the Apoſtles: ſo that hee who is ordained and confirmed, is the ſame after, that he was before impoſition of hands.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Apollonians</hi> bragge, that they are Chriſts Embaſſadors. This is an arrogant untruth, for they have not obtained the gift of teaching in the Church, after that divine and ſpirituall manner, that Chriſts Legates did of old; but by humane gifts, and humane calling, which according to Gods and Chriſts generall inſtitution, ſerve the now decayed Church, that wants theſe gifts in which ſhee excelled under the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>You are Gods Embaſſadors, and the Churches Patrons, to whom for ever by ſpeciall command the care of the Church under Chriſt is committed. Which not to undertake is hainous impiety, and to take it from you is ſacriledge, and now what I have ſaid to the ſecular Nobility, I alſo ſay to you that are Religious Miniſters. Contemne the boldneſſe of <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his fellows; for they are ſeditious and deſire innovation. They goe about to raiſe among themſelves the Papall Hierarchy, to the overthrow of your Honour: they hunt after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, and would have you loſe the true honour of Chriſt: All honour is due properly to Gods Word, not to you. Your Calling ſhould put you in minde of your Miniſtery and burthen, not of command and ruling. Which of you will bee ſo proud with <hi>Apollonius,</hi> as to bragge of an inſeparable ſubjection under
<pb facs="tcp:114151:11"/>Chriſt, ſo that hee truely heares Chriſt, that heares you? Let <hi>Apollonius</hi> be aſhamed, to bee ſo often convicted of falſehood, that hee is ſo infabibly ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Chriſt, as if his authority with Chriſts were the ſame.</p>
            <p>Liſien rather to Chriſt the Lord of the whole Church, who by command and examples hath taught you not to ſeek after the Kingdomes of this world, much leſſe by the Church. <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſeeks both, to wit, dominion in the Church, and by the Church, over Magistrates and the world too.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaid that Kings and Lords were to beare rule, but not you. Yet hee hath not driven out of the Church the higher power which is exerciſed with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but hath forbid you to meddle with that, which God hath granted to Magistrates. The Pope hath ſo corrupted this command of Chriſt, that by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, hee firſt ſtript Princes of their authority in the Church, and then from their temporall Dominions, and ſo procured to himſelf the dominion of the Church, then of the whole World: This is it which <hi>Apollonius</hi> borrows of him. Hee debarres Princes from having any authority in the Church, from which Christ never debarred them. On the contrary, hee affects dominion and power over the Church and State, which Chriſt never gave him; but plainly forbid him; Bee not therefore followers of <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Chriſt and his Apoſtles were indued with ſupreme authority, and what the Magistrate doth now by the Sword, that could they doe by words and threatning, that is to ſay, kill and puniſh corporally. They had power and aptitude to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all in the Church, but not to obey, notwithſtanding, they ſo ruled the Church, that they both governed, and were governed, they taught, and were taught; they ordered, and were ordered; they ſent, and were ſent. Finally, there was none of theſe things they did much affect, for which theſe proud and contentious ſpirits ſtrive, as it were for Religion it ſelfe: <hi>Stephanas</hi> and her family ſerved the Church with their goods, theſe were but vulgar people, and (as they called them) Laicks, yet <hi>Paul</hi> wills the whole Church, which excelled in ſo many ſpirituall gifts, <hi>to bee ſubject</hi> to them, and ſuch as they were, for that work: How farre was that government from this of <hi>Apollonius?</hi> on whom the Chriſtian Magiſtrate had beaped all ſorts of benefits, yet teacheth that hee muſt not bee ſubject to them, but they to him, that hee muſt not honour but contemne them;

Yet it is queſtioned whether or not this Law belongs to Chriſts Kingdome, which is ſpirituall and farre different from earthly Empires: And indeed there be ſome, otherwiſe good men, who think that our condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, is not like that of the ancients under the Law: Not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this world, but alſo becauſe Christ would not have his Church in the beginning to bee eſtabliſhed by the Sword, but whilſt Kings in promoting of Chriſts Kingdome, doe conſecrate their owne work; I deny that therefore the nature of it is changed. And although maugre all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, Christ would have his Goſpell to be proclaimed by his Diſciples, whem hee expoſed as ſheepe among Wolves, having no other Armour but his Word: yet hee did not tye himſelfe to an eternall Law, but that hee might force even Kings to his obedience, and tame their violence, and of bloody perſecutors, make them Patrons and Guardians of his Church. In the beginning Magistrates exerciſed their tyranny againſt the Church, becauſe the time was not yet come, that they ſhould Kiſſe the Sonne, and laying aſide their violence, ſhould become Nurſing Fathers to that ſame Church which they perſecutediaccording to <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Propheſie: which doubtleſſe hath reference to Chriſts com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it to no purpoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> bids us pray for Kings, and all that bee in authority, hee gives a cauſe, to wit, That under them wee may live quietly, in all godlineſſe and honeſty. As Chriſt is meek, ſo hee will have his Diſciples to follow him in meekneſſe; but this is no hinderance to Magistrates, why they may not have care of the Churches ſafety and tranquillity, in the defence of religion: for to neglect this duty, were extreame perfidiouſneſſe, and cruelty.

               <p>To theſe <hi>Apollonius</hi> addes further: <hi>we think it neither ſafe nor lawfull for a few ſmall queſtions about Church-government, to raiſe troubles: but now</hi> Vedelius <hi>was diſſipating the holy rites of the Church and the liberties, which Chriſt hath purchaſed with his own blood, hee had ſubjected to the yoake of forraigne power:</hi> hee means of the godly Magiſtrate: <hi>ſecretly ſpreading his poyſon: hee gave occaſion to Princes not very religious;</hi> he ſeems to tax the Magiſtrates of <hi>Middleburgh, that they ſhould in their tyrannicall luſt, flye upon the the rites of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be asked why all other Churches, and Claſſes ſat down, when the Church was in ſuch danger? he preferring himſelfe to all others, anſwers boldly: <hi>Truly I like not that any of our ſide, in whom the zeale of Gods Houſe is grown cold, in a cauſe of this moment ſhould be luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, ſit down and ſay nothing:</hi> as though he alone, of all the notable zelots, ſhould bee conſumed, by the fervent heat of Gods houſe, whom the unbridled luſt of railing, and cuſtome of lying, hath driven to write: which hereafter I will ſhew by divers examples, and will prove it by a famous one in this place.</p>
               <p>He feines that the Magiſtrate of <hi>Deventrie</hi> ſuppreſſed this tract of <hi>Vedelius. Anno.</hi> 1638. which afterwards <hi>Vedelius</hi> publiſhed in our <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie</hi> being <hi>but twice boyled coleworts.</hi> That this is a meer fiction, is cleare by Dr. <hi>Rivers</hi> letters concerning this tract which he wrot at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the 28 of <hi>February</hi> 1638. ſo that this <hi>Davus</hi> hath not well diſtinguiſhed his times: for how in the beginning of this yeare, could Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſee and allow this tract of <hi>Vedelius,</hi> if at that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114151:16"/>time it was ſuppreſſed by the Magiſtrate at <hi>Deventre.</hi> For either <hi>Vede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> publiſhed it without the knowledge and conſent of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate which is abſurd, or elſe the Magiſtrate did quickly retract his purpoſe of ſuppreſſing it, which had been no leſſe temerarious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, or elſe it is falſe what <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith, to wit, that either they did, or were willing to ſuppreſſe it, as may be ſeene by all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>For if <hi>Vedelius</hi> was ſuch a raverious woolfe againſt the Church of Chriſt, that then the Magiſtrate did ſuppreſſe his virulent writings, what boldneſſe was it according to the principles of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy for the Magiſtrate to fall upon a buſineſſe of this conſequence without the Clergies advice? what ſupine negligence was it that all Divines, in all Univerſities, ſhould be ſilent like dumb doggs, untill this <hi>Lobſter-eating-curre, Hylax,</hi> ſhould firſt bark from the remote <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachran</hi> iſle againſt Church-robbing; ſo that not onely doth he accuſe our Univerſity profeſſors, for too much ſtupidity, and want of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in that they did not obſerve <hi>Vedelius</hi> his poyſon, but preferred ſuch a ſacriledgious blaſphemer to be divinity profeſſour; but alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth <hi>Macovius,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> of perverſneſſe, who by their letters openly approved and commended <hi>Vedelius</hi> his tract and opinion, but if <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> had not maliciouſly winked with one of his eyes, he would have been more tender of the honour of ſuch worthy men.</p>
               <p>But one were as good ſeeke for foode in the fire, as for modeſty in <hi>Apollonius. Vedelius</hi> prefixed to his booke, the letters of <hi>Macovius</hi> and <hi>Rivet,</hi> which <hi>Apollonius</hi> would not ſee. But that every good man may ſee them, and hee too againſt his will, I'le ſet downe a few paſſages out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worthy Sir, your diſputation concerning the civill Magiſtrate againſt</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, <hi>I have read with ſo much the more diligence by how much the more exactneſſe it was written &amp;c. I doubt not but you'l do on acceptable work to thoſe, that deſires to know theſe things more exactly, &amp;c. I confeſſe that by this your learned tract, I am reſolved of thoſe things I doubted before, and am inſtructed in divers paſſages which I knew not &amp;c.</hi> thus far Macovius.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rivets</hi> judgement is more large, which is this. <hi>I have read and weighed the theologicall diſputation concerning the Magiſtrate againſt</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, <hi>which that famous and learned man</hi> N. Vedelius <hi>publiſhed, &amp;c. I teſtifie, that I have obſerved nothing in his anſwers and reſolutions, which in my judgement doth not agree with the doctrine of all reformed Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame argument, but eſpecially that in thoſe paſſages which hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114151:17"/>hath alledged out of my Comentaries upon the Decalogue, hee hath not wronged mee, but hath fully expreſſed my meaning, and I adjudge his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to bee very true, &amp;c. Therefore by this my hand-writing I would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to all men, that hee hath deſerved well of the Church, and who by his moſt learned lucubrations hath ſufficiently proved how farre hee is from the wayes of Innovators, &amp;c. Hee aſſerts the truth without prejudicing thoſe things which belong to the Miniſters of Gods word; and the Church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours according to Canonicall Scripture, and the Eccleſiaſtick Canons dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from thence; neither can I ſee any reaſon why Orthodox men ſhould in this buſineſſe trouble him.</hi> Thus Rivet.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader judge whether theſe men or <hi>Apollonius</hi> be made Sure they are diametrically oppoſite: for he commends <hi>Vedelius</hi> for an Orthodox man; but <hi>Apollonius</hi> for an Heterodox condemnes him. He clears him from innovation; this cries out that hee ſpreads abroad new Tares and poyſon. He ſaith that he aſſerts the truth; but this, that he defends ſacrilegious falſhoods. He witneſſeth by his hand-writing, that <hi>Vedelius</hi> hath deſerved well of the Church; but this by many ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhews, that he is a betrayer of the Churches rites and a trampler upon the blood of Chriſt. Laſtly, he ſaith, that no Orthodox man ſhould trouble him: but this on the contrary, by an Order of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachran Claſſis,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Synod,</hi> accuſeth him as a deſtroyer of, and a moſt bloody wolf to the Church. Hath not then <hi>Apollonius</hi> in this ſomewhat <hi>of that lying ſpirit which deceived Kings?</hi> ſo that he hath writ more of his Claſſiary brethren, then they knew themſelves, which is ordinary among the <hi>Apollonian</hi> ſpirituall men. One of theſe muſt be true; to wit, that either the <hi>Apollonians</hi> are convicted of ignorance, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and falſe tenets: or elſe that <hi>Vedelius, Macovius, &amp; Rivet,</hi> were widely miſtaken: for my own part I had rather be ſick with theſe men in divinity, then to enjoy the beſt health with the <hi>Walachran Apollonius:</hi> for he ſlights and deſpiſeth all men, weighing them in the ballance of his judgement, as if he alone were the man that could hold the ſcales, or were onely skilfull to note vice, and to diſcern right from wrong.</p>
               <p>Hee acknowledgeth that hee oweth much to <hi>Waleus,</hi> and <hi>Thyſius,</hi> his Maſters, and yet he doth with <hi>Junius,</hi> plainly reject them: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth <hi>Muſculus:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That Pareus and Gualter doe germanize it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114151:17"/>confuſion and collaterall combination of both Powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another place thus, <hi>this troubles us that ſo worthy a man,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Vedelius, <hi>ſhould eſteem of the Reformed-Church-doctrine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the teſtimony of ſome learned men, &amp;c.</hi> Ameſius, <hi>Martyr</hi> Sybrand, this honour he gives onely <hi>to Confeſſions, Catechiſmes, and formes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and yet he ſlights the Decrees of the Synod of <hi>Dort, as humane, and extorted from Miniſters againſt their wills,</hi> ſo that like a Snake feeding on naughty graſſe, he hiſſes at every thing as he pleaſeth; therefore the ghoſt of our famous <hi>Vedelius,</hi> againſt which <hi>Apollonius</hi> piſſeth, hath no great cauſe to be angry, ſince he is not aſhamed to ſpit in the face of all learned men.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that both ſacred and profane Laws do more deteſt &amp; puniſh then the contempt of Princes, and ſuperior powers; of which this Night-bird was not ignorant; who preſently in the preface, deſires the Magiſtrates good will: for he ſaith <hi>that he carryeth a free ſpirit in the maintenance of their Magistracy,</hi> and as it were calling God to patronize his diſſimulation, <hi>that with moſt fervent prayers he honours God for them,</hi> when as notwithſtanding with full cheeks he blows out contumelious ſpeeches againſt Princes and Magiſtrates: and as if he were another <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> he aſſumes power to appoint what limits Magiſtrates muſt cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ves within, beyond which if they offer to goe, he calls them <hi>Symoniacks,</hi> and wicked; and like irreligious Princes: that they break in upon the rights and prerogatives of the Church, with ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall luſt and violence; for which prerogatives, he ſaith, Chriſt did ſhed his Hood, and ſuch Princes he calls civil Popes. But whilſt he divides this booty and power, he acts the Lion in <hi>Aeſop,</hi> who dividing the Veneſon with the Aſſe, and the Fox he killed the Aſſe, &amp; affrighted the Fox; and ſo took all the booty to himſelf. <hi>Apollonius</hi> here playes the Jugler, and with counterfeit ſuperſtition deterres the Magiſtrate from touching any of the modern Eccleſiaſtick affaires.</p>
               <p>For he teacheth that the power of the Magiſtrate is not <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>about</hi> the Church; and that the internalls of the Church doth not belong to him, either <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>eminently,</hi> or <hi>totally,</hi> or <hi>partially,</hi> that his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends onely to the externalls, and not all theſe neither, but only the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals externally,</hi> but not the <hi>externals internally:</hi> for in theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he is very exact and ſeemingly carefull of the conſcience of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. He warnes them that they beleeve not <hi>the judgements of the learned, nor the authority of man,</hi> in exerciſing of their power, earneſtly urging his deciſions as conſonant to Scripture: among which theſe are ſome.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114151:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The power of the Civill ſword is without the Spheare of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction. The Godly Magiſtrate is not the prime member of the Church, but of the baſer ſort,</hi> yea, of the baſeſt. That it is dangerous to call the Magiſtrate the <hi>Keeper, or nurſing Father of the Church;</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible for him to nouriſh the Church with true milk, which is onely proper for Church-men; <hi>That the Magiſtrate is onely a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable accident of the Church, which may be preſent or abſent without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the ſubject; That the end and intent of the Magiſtrate was not the ſaving of ſoules, but properly and onely the temporall things of this life;</hi> That the office of the Magiſtrate was onely of earthly, not of heavenly things; <hi>That the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, cannot execute any ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall worke;</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible <hi>that hee ſhould bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated above his own nature</hi> which is altogether worldly, carnall, and corporall. Or if he ſeem to doe any Eccleſiaſticall buſineſſe, that this hee doth onely <hi>objectively</hi> not formally; imperatively, not elici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; in reſpect of worldly circumſtances, and not in regard of the <hi>ſubſtantials of the Church; And that they who will attribute more than this to the Magiſtrate, incline to</hi> Pelagianiſme.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſpeakes every where of the Magiſtrate, as of a naturall and carnall man, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he is not ſubject to the Law of God; nor can be; nor doth he comprehend the things of Gods Spirit.</hi> Hee cites often <hi>Gerſom Bucerus,</hi> who was to cunning in theſe trifles, and withall inſenced King <hi>James</hi> againſt him, ſo that he was like to ſuffer had not the States protected him. But this our <hi>Apollonius</hi> unwilling to yeeld to any man <hi>(ſo bold is ignorance)</hi> hee leapes over all the tearmes of <hi>Bucerus,</hi> and railes againſt his own Magiſtrates and States, ſubſcribing to no mans opinion except <hi>Calderwoods;</hi> the ſum of which he elſe-where cites out of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kingly authority (ſaith he) is onely meaſured according to the Churches benefit;</hi> yet he doth warne Church-men that they ſhould not truſt too much Magiſtrates: <hi>for he compares them to a crafty ſervant, but Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a generous Horſe;</hi> openly warning his fellow-Miniſters, that they ſuffer not the Magiſtrates to ride them any more, and that their main aim was to bring them under ſubjection: But if once they get the Maſtery, that Miniſters ſhal never be able hereafter to ſhake off the civill yoak. So then, <hi>Apollonius</hi> thinkes it a main peece of ſanctity, to ſow perpetuall ſtrife, and make a breach between the Magiſtrates and Miniſters, as if it were a holy duty in Miniſters to demand and take from godly Magiſtrates all the benefits they can; but ſtill to beware of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114151:18"/>their deceipts and treacheries: the Reader cannot be ſo ſtupid, as not to ſmell out the mockes and reproaches of <hi>Apolonius</hi> through his whole work, againſt religious Magiſtrates; ſome of which I will now ſet downe, that every one may ſee, what kind of vermin this <hi>Apolonius</hi> is, who like a Waſp, or Hornet, goeth about to ſting not onely our famous <hi>Vedelius,</hi> but <hi>Macovius</hi> alſo, <hi>Rivet,</hi> his own Maſters; the beſt Divines of Chriſtendome; the Nationall Synod; and the High and Mighty States themſelves; yet notwithſtanding this giddy head, who pretends a maiden-like modeſty, in the end of his Preface thus writes:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſeriouſly affirme, that concerning this cauſe, I have almoſt brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my own; but have robbed the Lucubrations and Coffers of other men; and have collected whatſoevr Divines have ſcatteringly ſayd of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> Thus like <hi>Proteus,</hi> ſometimes he lookes like a Lion, and ſometimes like a Buck: He is a ſhrill Trumpeter of his own vertues every where; but chiefly in this place, where he ſubjects himſelfe to all learned men, when as indeed he exalts himſelfe above them all: So that he ſlights al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every man in compariſon of himſelfe: how ever I will not envie this Locuſt the honour which he affecteth, to wit, that hee hath skipped over many mens Gardens, and gnawed their Flowers; this I'le ſay free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he hath taken more pains to turn over negligently humane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, then diligently the holy Scriptures; as I wil hereafter make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. I confeſſe indeed, that he like a Hog, or like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cock, hath laboriouſly turned over the Dung-hills of Popes, School-men, Jeſuites, Apoſtates and Sophiſters; perhaps that he might find out the Jewell of Truth, which if he thought in-glorious to find, in the neighbouring and pure Medowes of holy Scriptures, as being leſſe ſpirituall (which I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) hee deſerveth to be defiled with their ſtench and filth, and to be laughed at by all learned and godly men. It is enough for me, that I have made <hi>Apolonius</hi> his diſſembled modeſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe appear; but withall, his Dogs face, and impudency towards all. The mans mad pride might be tolerated, if he could any where elſe ſhew us his skill in Grammer or Logick: but he who hath either a mind, or leaſure (which I confeſſe are wanting to me) to turn over all his patched Peeces, ſhall find that he harps an hundred times on one ſtring, like a ridiculous Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſo that one would nauſeat to heare him: He is ſo little verſed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin phraſes, that he deſerves to be whipt by <hi>Priſcian</hi> for his many ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes: for he uſeth frequently the word <hi>coerciva</hi> for <hi>coercitiva:</hi> A great deale he hath of ſuch barbarous ſtuffe, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cannot bear, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for his Logick, although with a wide mouth he promiſe great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114151:19"/>matters, yet he playes but a Canvaſſe Merchant, imitating every where that Paraſite in <hi>Plautus: I ſell ridiculous ſayings, goe too, come and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen cavils, flatteries, and phantaſticall perjuries.</hi> I purpoſe not to run through all his labyrinths, he cannot follow the guide of his own thread, I will briefly contract his fooliſh circumlocutions thus: <hi>The Church of Chriſt is holy and ſpirituall,</hi> Therefore all her affaires, and chiefly her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is holy and ſpirituall. From hence he gathers this conſequence, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the government &amp; buſineſſe of the Church (which he calls <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing</hi>) belongs onely to the Saints, or ſpirituall men, that is, Miniſters, becauſe they by ſpeciall priviledge of their vocation, are ſanctified and conſecrated. From hence alſo he drawes out another confectary, thus: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Theſe Church-affaires belong not to <hi>Godly civill Magiſtrates;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not ſanctified to this work, but are altogether unfit, as being <hi>but mean members of the Church, worldly, whoſe power is diſpoticall, or Lordly, Architectonicall and corporall, earthly, not heavenly, which can produce no ſpirituall effect, or touch the ſoul.</hi> Theſe are the Coleworts which he ſo often in his madneſſe ſets down to us. I will handle each of them in order: But firſt, let the Reader be fore-warned, that this whole <hi>Apolonian</hi> Fable for Church-government, which he begins, is ſo like the Popiſh Scheme, that almoſt they differ in nothing, ſave one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y that with the Pope this is an old Comedy, and a thing in poſſeſſion; but among the <hi>Apolonian Walachrans,</hi> there are new Actors, and a thing onely in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. Surely, ſuch is the affinity every where of their principles, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and argumentations, that whoſoever will but compare the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of old Papiſts with theſe new ones, will eaſily finde, that the ſame Romiſh Church was mother to them both. I confeſſe <hi>Apolonius</hi> is not ſo unskilfull of cheating or juggling, but for faſhions ſake he hiſſes at Popery, and by this trick he cleares himſelfe from Arminianiſme, but brands our famous <hi>Vedelius</hi> with it. This is the old trick of Heretickes, and of all Novaliſts, and as it were whoriſh paintings, wherewith they paint their deformed ſcabs. There is nothing wherein the Papiſts have more deluded the world, then under the name of <hi>Church-holineſſe and ſpirituality;</hi> by which ſuperſtitious pretences the Pope hath gotten to himſelf the government of the whole world: which web this our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> hath begun again, and hath made up the whole wooffe of the ſame threads; ſo that almoſt in every page he caſts abroad the lofty words of Church-holineſſe and modern-ſpirituality.

               <p>THe word <hi>Church</hi> in Scripture ſometime ſignifieth every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Aſſembly of men gathered together, whatſoever be the manner or end of their meeting. So that ſeditious concourſe of men at <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> is by <hi>Luke</hi> called <hi>the Church;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecceeſia, Acts</hi> 29.38, 38.</note> twice in that place is this word uſed for that tumultuous Aſſembly of ſeditious men. But more ſpecially it notes the Aſſemblies of men gathered together for the publick worſhip of God, whether this Aſſembly be great or ſmall. So <hi>Paul</hi> honours private meetings at home, by the name of <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> as thoſe private meetings in the houſes of <hi>Stephana,</hi> and others, for private devotion. Now the forme of theſe Churches doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſiſt in the myſticall and internall union with Chriſt; but onely in the externall union which theſe men have among themſelves, when they meet to worſhip Chriſt, and to make profeſſion of their faith: the chiefe heads of which conſiſt in the preaching, reading, expounding, or any ways meditating in the word of God, in adminiſtring the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts upon occaſion; laſtly, in exerciſing the workes of charity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Chriſts Diſciples did, living according to the preſcript of Chriſts lawes. But moſt ſpecially the word <hi>Church</hi> ſignifieth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of all that have been, or ſhall be ſaved from the beginning to the end of the world; which is the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. to which appertain many Jewes, and innumerable Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Church, ſo did many Fathers write, <hi>Auſtine</hi> thus:

                  <hi>The Citizens of heavenly Ieruſalem are all ſanctified men, who have been, are, or ſhall be.</hi> The forme of this Church conſiſteth <hi>in a true union with Chriſt by Faith,</hi> being ſpirituall, myſticall and indiſſoluble; which the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth divers wayes, chiefly when he calls her <hi>Chriſts my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body,</hi> of which he is the head, and every true beelever a member, and as it were <hi>fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> Oftentimes alſo this Church is called, <hi>The Spouſe and Wife of Chriſt,</hi> to ſignifie the true and inſeparable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and moſt fervent love of Chriſt to thoſe that truly beleeve.</p>
               <p>To this laſt Church properly belong theſe famous Encomiums, that ſhe is One, Catholick, Holy, Spirituall, Clean without ſpot or wrinkle, that ſhe is not of this world, but heavenly, that Chriſt for her hath ſhed his blood, and prayed for her; not for the world; that ſhe cannot erre, or fall away, becauſe the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt her.

               <p>Truly, if externall and viſible Churches either each one, or all, be the Body and Spouſe of Chriſt, will not they beſtow on Chriſt a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and deformed Spouſe, which is burdened with ſo many rotten members of the Divell. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that he might avoyd this abſurdity, feignes that thoſe wicked men are not properly true members of the Church, but are to be eſteemed <hi>as nailes and haires.</hi> (I wonder he doth not tell us of lice alſo running among the haires of Chriſts Spouſe.) Indeed the Jeſuits Fables concerning the Church, and Spouſe of Chriſt, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, when they give her ſuch an ugly head of haire, intangled and made up of wicked men, and ſonnes of hell; much like the diſeaſe among the Polonians, called <hi>Plica.</hi> For if the wicked be the haires of Chriſts Spouſe, it muſt follow that the haires of Chriſts Spouſe muſt be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with everlaſting fire, which indeed were monſtrous and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Chriſts Spouſe ſhould have a head like <hi>Mednſa's,</hi> whoſe hairs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114151:20"/>were infolded with ſnakes: for it is plain, that in the viſible Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are found, not onely Lay-men, but Clergy-men alſo, that are the very generation of Vipers; if all theſe are in the Church of Chriſt, as haires, the Spouſe of Chriſt ſhould not be pure and faire, but defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and laden with an ugly head of haire, conſiſting of the ſonnes of Satan.</p>
               <p>Other Jeſuits ſay, that theſe wicked men are in the Church, Body and Spouſe of Chriſt, not as members and parts, but as corrupted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and impoſthumes; but the ſame abſurditie will ariſe: For this is known, that viſible Churches for the moſt part, doe conſiſt of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and wicked men; but how abſurd is this that Chriſt ſhould have ſuch a Body, ſuch a Spouſe, which continually hath putrid ſoares run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which hath every day filthy impoſthumes growing; and ſordid ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſtill increaſing, which will hardly be healed up into a skarre.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that ſometimes the title of <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and other notable Elogies are given to the externall congregations of Chriſtians; but this is ſpoken either improperly, or becauſe of Gods worſhip exerciſed among them; or elſe out of the judgement of charity, becauſe of the elect and true beleevers found in theſe Congregations.

               <p>This is the firſt faliacy which the Jeſuits admit in the word <hi>Church,</hi> that they might draw men into a ſuperſtitious reverence of the viſible Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>This new Popiſh <hi>Walachran,</hi> with his fellowes, harp altogether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſtring, that they may induce men to admire their viſible Church: he diſtinguiſheth indeed exactly between the Church viſible and inviſible; and he ſhewes in many pages, that thoſe notable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges doe properly and onely belong to the inviſible, not to the viſible Church. But this he ſeems to have done cunningly, to deceive the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> as if he diſſented from the Papiſts, whereas he is indeed every where the Popes Champion, fighting with his weapons: for he transferres all the praiſes and priviledges of the inviſible Church upon the viſible: for through all his hodge-podge againſt <hi>Vedelius,</hi> he ſpeaks of the right government in the viſible Church, of the power and offices of the viſible Church; as publick preaching and praying, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, calling to the Miniſtery, cenſure and publick excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114151:21"/>the giving of lawes, and finally, the whole furniture of the outward Miniſtery, which every one knowes to be the externall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible buſineſſe of the viſible Church; yet he every where commends this Church, calling her <hi>the Houſe, Body, and Spouſe of Chriſt, ſpiritual &amp; holy, whom Chriſt bought with his own blood.</hi> Alſo, when he ſpeaks of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miniſtery of his Church, he ſaith, <hi>That ſhe being the Spouſe and body of Chriſt, hath certain priviledges &amp; ſacred rights.</hi> And ſometimes he is ſo laviſh in extolling the outward affaires of the viſible Church, that he affirmeth Chriſt to have <hi>ſhed his blood for thoſe priviledges and rights;</hi> juſt like a Jugler he goeth about to perſwade the Magiſtrate, that when he offers to meddle with the buſineſſe of this <hi>Apolonian</hi> and viſible Church, without her order, that he commits ſacriledge againſt the true and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, which is the Body and Spouſe of Chriſt. So that with no leſſe immodeſty doth hee keep them off from all outward Church-buſineſſe, then if they were Bawds or Pandors, offering to deflower Chriſts holy Spouſe, if they goe beyond the bounds preſcribed by him: So that not only doth he contradict himſelfe, but by a Popiſh trick endeavoureth to ſet forth his Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction, perſwading men, that his Church which is indeed viſlble, is to bee accounted for the Spouſe of Chriſt, and therefore the Miniſtery of this Spouſe to belong onely to him and his Clergy, as if they were the brides Spirituall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymphs.</p>
               <p>The other errour of the ancient Papiſts, is, that the honour and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the viſible Church, which is ſo largely extended, is contracted by them to government and Governours of the Church, for thoſe they call properly the repreſentative Church, to wit, their Biſhops and Clergie: So that if you ask them, who are Church-men?

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32.</note> And they were ſo farre from contending about the priviledge of juriſdiction, or from debarring the body of the Church, from medling with Miniſterial buſineſſes, that they permitted every man to exerciſe them, if ſo be he were fitted, without the ſolemnity of outward calling, and gave way to the whole Body of the Church, that is, to all Chriſtians, to debate about, and determine the moſt ſacred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Church: Nor was it held abſurd (though this Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114151:22"/>think it ſo now) by theſe great lights of the Church; for the ſame to call and to be called; to ſend and to be ſent; to teach and to be taught; to be above and to be under, to rule and to be ruled; to help and to be helped: So that this Stilt-walker hath not borrowed from the Apoſtles that exact right of Church-government, and the prerogative of power in the Church <hi>Repreſenting,</hi> upon the Church <hi>Repreſented,</hi> (that is, upon the body and members of the Church,) but from the Pope, the Roman Antichriſt. For he by a fatall <hi>Energie</hi> and efficacie of deceiving, did firſt ſeaſon Chriſtians with an immoderate ſuperſtition of the viſible Church, and outward worſhip; ſo that they attributed more to her then was fit: the care of which afterward he transferred upon the Clergy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as being conſecrated for this work, and withall, deduced all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to Church-men, and the governours thereof, as though they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had right in Church-affaires, from which other Chriſtians, as being Lay-men, were debarred: but afterward by degrees he transferred to himſelfe the whole dignity of the Clergie, and ſo at length became the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of all Eccleſiaſtick dignity and ſanctity, ſo that now for many yeares hee is reputed and called, the head of the Church; yea, the very Church repreſentative, by which he plainly ſhewes himſelfe to be Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>That Roman Baſilisk did not ſuddenly, but by degrees peep out of ſmall myſteries: on whoſe egges, becauſe of late this <hi>Treverian</hi> doth ſit, if pious Princes doe not in time fore-ſee the cunning, there will in ſtead of one, ariſe many Antichriſts.</p>
               <p>For if the ſanctity of the Catholick Church be in the viſible Church; if the ſanctity of the viſible Church be in the repreſenting Church, that is, in the governours, ſuppoſe in the Conſiſtory, or Claſſis, &amp;c. if the dignity of the Conſiſtory be reſtrained to Miniſters as the eyes, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour in the Church (for the Elders are for the moſt part, but the Miniſters foot-ſtools) if the dignity of many Paſtors reſide at laſt in ſome one chiefe Paſtor, to whoſe dreames all other Paſtors muſt ſubſcribe, either out of ignorance or negligence (as you may ſee in the <hi>Walachran</hi> Claſſis) who doth not now ſee that all the holineſſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the whole Church, flowes into this chiefe Paſtor, as into a ſink-hole? To whoſe impudencie and madneſſe if no Miniſter dare or will make reſiſtance; if no Magiſtrate muſt under pain of ſacriledge; ſhall not he in the end be Pope of that Iſland, or Province?</p>
               <p>The third errour borrowed from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is this, they uſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude to us their viſible Roman Church in ſtead of the Catholick, and for the whole Church, that part only which governeth; and in lieu of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114151:22"/>the Church, they recommend to us the government thereof. Laſtly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of government and the Apoſtolicall Church, they thruſt upon us all the fictions and dreames of their brain-ſick Popes: ſo that among them, the Church-government is no more like that of the Apoſtles, then a vizard is like a true face, or a picture like a man. Though this <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> be not as yet ſo impudent, yet becauſe he is continually brawling with the Magiſtrates, as with worldly men, about the right of making lawes in Church matters; he doth plainly ſhew, that he is of the Popes mind in impoſing upon Chriſtians this yoak, and upon Magiſtrates themſelves, under pretence of Eccleſiaſtick dignity: ſo that whatſoever the <hi>Apolonian</hi> Colledge in <hi>Walachran</hi> ſhall judge to be holy, and to be fit or neceſſary for the Church, Chriſts Spouſe, muſt be received with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, under pain of excommunication.

               <p>The word <hi>Sanctity</hi> ſignifieth properly the inward and perfect inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of a thing, ſuch as is in God <hi>eminently;</hi> hence in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy:</hi> to whoſe nature, becauſe the bleſſed Angels and Soules in heaven come neereſt, they alſo are called <hi>Holy.</hi> And although in regard of corporiety, Chriſts humane nature is diſtant from the divine; yet in reſpect of the incomprehenſible priviledge of the Hypoſtaticall union, by which it is perſonally united to the divine Nature, it's not to be doubted, but that the Majeſty and dignity of Chriſts glorious body, ſitting at Gods right hand in heaven, is ineffable; ſo that this body may be juſtly called <hi>Moſt holy:</hi> Such are the bodies of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> but in a lower degree: inferiour to which is the heaven, and place of the bleſſed; all which notwithſtanding are truly, inherently, and after their manner, perfectly holy, and free from all pollution.</p>
               <p>This word is alſo transferred to many other things, chiefly to the worſhip of God; becauſe this tends to the glory of the <hi>moſt holy God,</hi> and is the mean by which men are brought into the poſſeſſion of that true and perfect holineſſe which wee ſhall enjoy in heaven: hence the <hi>worſhip of God,</hi> and the manner or meanes of this worſhip; laſtly, the perſons converſant about this worſhip, are called, and are ſo, in ſome meaſure, <hi>Holy.</hi> But we muſt be cautious in uſing this diſtinction: for the confuſion of theſe things will eaſily beget pride in the preſumptuous, and Idolatry in the ſuperſtitious.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more ſure, then that this deſerves beſt the name of <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> which hath in it ſelf a perpetuall and inherent perfection and ordination for promoting Gods worſhip and mans ſalvation: For God is ſo holy, that whatſoever hath him for its Authour, and is ordained to his holineſſe, is to be accounted holy.</p>
               <p>Such are the vertues which by the holy Ghoſt are infuſed into us; as wiſdome, hope, love, and chiefly true juſtifying faith, which therefore in Scripture is called <hi>Moſt holy;</hi> becauſe not onely is it holy, and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in it ſelfe; but whoſoever alſo is endowed with it, though he had been never ſo prophane before, and moſt unworthy in the eyes of the world, yet with God he is holy and elect, becauſe he is inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt; but myſtically <hi>by faith:</hi> For though Faith doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently change a man, as to be endowed with inherent ſanctity, yet he is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114151:23"/>brought to have a firm hope of attaining perfect holineſſe in heaven, the beginning of which he obtaines here by ſanctification, after the infuſion of true faith; ſo that the name of <hi>Sanctity</hi> doth very well belong to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, as having God alone, who is moſt holy, for its Authour; and where-ever it is infuſed, it cauſeth an inſeparable holineſſe in that man: which is the reaſon that every where in Scripture true beleelvers are called the <hi>holy Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe vertues ſucceeds <hi>Gods Word,</hi> which having the moſt holy God for its Authour, is in it ſelfe perfectly <hi>holy.</hi> For how can any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane thing be found in that word, which is known to be uttered and written by the inſtinct and motion of the holy Ghoſt: So that our moſt holy Faith is begot of this, as of an immortall ſeed; but here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that juſtifying faith, in whomſoever it is, makes that man holy; but ſo doth not Gods word all them to whom it is given, becauſe God commits the knowledge and preaching thereof to moſt prophane and wicked men; ſo that the whole worſhip of God is not more holy then <hi>true Faith and God word:</hi> For it is wholly appointed to beget faith, and the Word is the originall and onely meaſure of the whole worſhip.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114151:24"/>yet it did not change the nature of thoſe things: for they were made up of gold, ſilver, pretious ſtones, and other naturall things; and doubtleſſe they were at laſt fewell for the fire, and booties for wicked Plunderers: For <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes, that when <hi>Titus</hi> triumphed, amongſt other ſpoyles was carried <hi>the Law of the two Tables;</hi> which with ſuch veneration was hid in the Ark within the Holy of Holies: So then, this ſanctity was neither inherent, nor permanent, but relative onely, and temporall: which I cannot better expreſſe, then by comparing it to a houſe with its Utenſils, where a Prince ſojournes for a while: So long as he remains there, becauſe of his Majeſty, and pomp, there is nothing in the houſe which derives not thence ſome dignity and ſplendor, which notwithſtanding is neither in the houſe nor utenſils properly: For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it ceaſeth when the Majeſty of the Prince is removed from thence.</p>
               <p>The ſame muſt be affirmed of perſonall ſanctity, when God admits ſome to the charge of his worſhip: For if there be no inherent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall dignity in the <hi>place and things</hi> appoynted for divine worſhip, how much leſſe can this be in the <hi>perſons</hi> which are ordained for handling of the things belonging to his worſhip? This may be ſeen in the Levits, whoſe whole ſtock God had choſen and conſecrated out of all the Jewes for his worſhip; who therefore were called, and were ſo indeed a <hi>Holy</hi> people; yet from thence there was not in them any inherent perfection or integrity, as may be ſeen in <hi>Eli</hi> his ſonnes, who were wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and even <hi>Samuels</hi> ſonnes for their vices were removed from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Prieſthood: So that from hence it is evident, that there is no inherent and perpetuall holineſſe in perſons appoynted for divine worſhip, but only of relation and ordination; ſo much as was fit for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of their function.</p>
               <p>I grant that ſometimes God is ſo bountifull, that he hath with the holy Office, conferred alſo gifts and vertues; as when he beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saul</hi> with the Crown, the good ſpirit of government, eſpecially when he furniſhed the Prophets and Apoſtles with the inherent gifts of Faith, Piety, and Miracles: But this is ſure, that God never ſo tied himſelfe to man, as alwayes to ſanctiſie thoſe inwardly whom he calls to a holy function outwardly: for he made uſe of an Aſſe to teach, of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Sorcerer to propheſie, and of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor to the honour of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>The like reaſon is of <hi>times:</hi> for as God hath conſecrated <hi>things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and places,</hi> ſo he hath done dayes, ſuch as the Sabbath, and other Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114151:24"/>by Gods ordination onely more eminent, as it was appoynted for holy worſhip; which condition ceaſing, the day became vulgar.</p>
               <p>I have been ſomewhat large in explaining this <hi>externall and relative ſanctity,</hi> that the unwary may not be deceived by them, who ſpeak ſo proudly of this priviledge of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> that whereſoever this word <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> is uſed, they will have us beleeve, that there is meant a perpetuall and permanent firmneſſe of dignity and integrity.</p>
               <p>Experience hath taught us this among the Papiſts: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſeth, that the worſhip of Images, dead men, and reliques in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> proceeded from the perſwaſion of holineſſe in thoſe men, and of Gods aſſiſtance; which becauſe they had whilſt they lived, therefore they think the ſame to be perpetually faſtened to their Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, graves, reliques, and very Images, ſo that they ſuppoſe they are bound to honour them, or God being in that place. I will not ſay how often theſe deceivers abuſe and delude ſuperſtitious people, by preſenting oftentimes the reliques of Knaves, Theeves, Dogges, and Apes in ſtead of Saints; only this I'le ſay, that they are deceived in ſubjecting Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to their pleaſures, whilſt they feigne his power to be tyed to theſe things and perſons in all places, in which it hath been ſometimes: for ſo in all things and perſons there muſt be an inherent and perpetuall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and perfection, as often as he conſecrates them once for ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe. The falſhood of which appeares in the overthrow of the Jewiſh Temple, and ſpoyle of all its utenſils: for who but a ſuperſtitious man wil now ſearch for holines in that place where God firſt ſpake with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> or in the top of <hi>Mount Sinai?</hi> where he proclaimed the Law with ſuch a miracle; Who will ſeek for holineſſe in the rubbiſh of the Jewiſh Temple, which Chriſt ſo curſed, that when to his diſhonour <hi>Julian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to re-build it, he was forced to deſiſt from his work,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>becauſe of flames breaking out of the earth, and the element it ſelf making reſiſtance,</hi> if the Arke or Propitiatorie, if the Cherubim and Tables of the Law, if the holy Breaſt-plate, and what elſe was venerable in the Jewes Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, were now preſent, there were no more holines to be placed in them, then in any other ordinary utenſils, which we know have yeelded to the fire or the Plunderer.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe this new Popiſh <hi>Walachran</hi> is not ſo laviſh in extolling of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> as to give worſhip and veneration to dead men and reliques; but yet he agrees with the Jeſuits his School-maſters, in this, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things and perſons belonging to divine worſhip, he ſtill placeth ſuch a high myſtery of dignity and perfection, that not onely doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the ſanctity of his Church-diſcipline; above all worldly buſineſſe, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114151:25"/>alſo he doth ſo wonderfully dignifie Miniſters, by reaſon of their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he openly cries out, that worldly Magiſtrates, though they be the members of Chriſts Church, cannot attain to that myſticall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though never ſo willing.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the figments of <hi>Delphick</hi> Impoſtors, and ſuch as are drunk with Idolatry, to beare men alwayes in hand, that the externall matters of Religion, are alwayes ſecret, and myſteries not to be touched, that ſo they might draw ignorant people to ſuperſtition, and an admiration of them; this is the trick of old Papiſts, to perſwade men to beleeve won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the holineſſe of their Church-diſcipline, that they might place a myſticall ſanctity there, where none is. For although in multiplicity of Ceremonies, which Clergy-men affect in Church-buſineſſes, there wants not toyle and labour, yet there is no Lay-man ſo fooliſh, but he can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imitate that confuſed Maſſe of Hiſtrionicall trifles which they uſe. The Papiſts have borrowed a great deale of their Church-dreſſings and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctities, from the ceremoniall Leviticall Prieſthood; and the <hi>Walachran Night-bird</hi> borrowes from both: For although it be cleare by Chriſts own prediction,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.</note> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> throughout, that the whole outward pomp of that worſhip, with its coſtlineſſe and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Functions, have fallen with the fall of the Temple; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the Prieſthood he meaſures every where the right of the modern Miniſtery, &amp; upon the prerogatives of the old Levites, he builds his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of ſanctity and preheminence over all civill Magiſtrates. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know that in this he childiſhly doth Judaiſe, (which all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men reject) yet it will be no difficulty even out of the preſcript of Jewiſh worſhip, to convince theſe turbulent <hi>Walachrians</hi> of novelty and boldneſſe.</p>
               <p>For if Chriſtians muſt meaſure their worſhip, according to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ceremonies of the Jewes, it is needfull that either they imitate them in all things, or elſe that ſome <hi>Oedipus</hi> reſolve us this Riddle, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto not reſolved, to wit, what is Morall and Imitable in thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, what not? The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by right and wrong, by the ſole priviledge, in that he is Antichriſt, takes upon him the liberty to make uſe of ſuch Jewiſh and Gentile ceremonies, as may be moſt conducing for the pomp and coveniencie of his holineſſe. Amongſt the Divines of the reformed Church, ſome have more painfully laboured then others, in rowling this ſtone of <hi>Siſiphus,</hi> the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Stilt-walker, ſwelling with ignorant pride more then others, defines and appoints many things, as it were from <hi>Apollos Tripos,</hi> among other matters, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> doe ſhamefully Judaiſe, for ſuffering the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114151:25"/>conſent of Organs in the Church, to keep people in tune, whilſt they ſing Pſalmes, and divers other things, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, that hee may procure reverence to his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, and the prerogative of myſticall ſanctity to himſelfe and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, againſt and over all godly Princes and Magiſtrates, hee thinkes this to be (perpetuall and morall,) that there be a preciſe ſeparation and diſtinction of Eccleſiaſtick Offices, and of Church-men and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; ſo that theſe upon no tearms muſt meddle with any ſpiritual bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, which may any way concern the ſalvation of ſoules; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to take upon them the whole charge and care of ſpirituality, and ſaving of ſoules; ſo that if the Magiſtrate offer to meddle with theſe buſineſſes, he offends no leſſe then of old he that would ſacrifice being no Levit, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> did; whoſe example is alwayes in his mouth, and whoſe puniſhment he threatens againſt the Magiſtrate, if they meddle with Church-diſcipline, or hinder Miniſters from executing all things freely with <hi>Apolonian</hi> zeale. His frivolous heap of reaſons, by which he would perſwade us to this, we will refute as we proceed.</p>
               <p>But I will now refell his prime triumphing reaſon, in which he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where glories, that under the Leviticall worſhip of the old Law, there was ſo exact a ſeparation of theſe Offices and Functions, whence hee concludes; If it was thus under the carnall Jewes, much more ſhould this difference now be obſerved among the ſpirituall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt. But that I know how familiar it is with this Pratler, to preſuppoſe every where falſhoods, I would anſwer that the conſequence of his Argument is childiſh. For this reaſon is no better, then if he ſhould argue thus: The carnall Jewes had but one Temple, one Citie, to which they muſt repaire every yeare to worſhip God, where they had the Holy of Holies, out of which God delivered his undoubted Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; therefore much more now doth this belong to the Chriſtians, a more ſpirituall people.</p>
               <p>Again, among the carnall Jewes none did ſacrifice in the Temple, but the poſterity of <hi>Levi,</hi> to whom this ſanctity was peculiar, that all were born to this priviledge, which none but of this Tribe could enjoy: Therefore now amongſt ſpirituall Chriſtians, it is much more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the Miniſteriall ſanctity be not common to all, but be reſtrained likewiſe to one ſtock.</p>
               <p>Which affertion not onely will ingenious men deny, but even Papiſts alſo, and <hi>Apolonius</hi> himſelfe. For among them it were too bad to tye the Eccleſiaſticall dignity to one Stock; becauſe Clergy-ſanctity at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the moſt part, is the ſanctuary of Beggery and Knavery; ſo<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114151:26"/>that it skills not whence, or out of what Stock one is born, ſo he be skilfull in the Art of Symonie: for then he ſhall eaſily attain this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And if all worldly hopes faile him, his Progeny will not hinder him: For <hi>Deſperation makes a Monke,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, which is the top of higheſt Helineſſe: Which Chaire, though it be ſo holy and powerfull, that the moſt wicked Pope in the world by it is alwayes <hi>Made or found holy,</hi> as they ſpeake; yet it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Leviticall, but that it hath admitted Monſters of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Stockes, and Sexes, as if it were a common Stewes; ſo they know the Art of wooing that <hi>Lais. Platina</hi> tells us, that <hi>French, Dutch, Aſiatickes, Greekes, Africans,</hi> and not onely Men, but a Woman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Joan,</hi> a whore, about the yeare 998, ſate in this Chaire.</p>
               <p>Now if this fiction of <hi>Apolonius</hi> were true, all thoſe Monſters of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> had been quite fruſtrated, to wit, if the government of Chriſts Church ſhould be derived from the Leviticall, and tyed to one Stock. So that this Stilt-walker is neither favourable to himſelfe, nor fellowes, if he will have all his Miniſteriall Rites according to the Levitical manner. Whereas not onely he himſelf hath crept out of a Lay conſular Family, into the ſacred Eccleſiaſtick Chaire: but ſome alſo have leapt out of the Bakers, Weavers, and Shoo-makers ſhops, into the Pulpit; and ſome of Mechanicall Tylers, or Brick-layers, have become grave Miniſters.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that this is no other thing then what Chriſt did ſhew in the Apoſties, when he choſe Diſciples out of Fiſher-men, Publicans, Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and all ſort of Mechanickes; onely this I ſay, that if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Church-diſcipline be ordered according to the Leviticall, as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> prates, then Chriſt ſhewed a bad example and the <hi>Walach ian</hi> Novaliſt hath prepoſterouſly followed, in excluding other ſtockes, doth not tye the hope of Miniſterial Church-ſanctity to one ſtock alone.</p>
               <p>But now I will deale bountifully with the <hi>Walachrans,</hi> and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to defend their cauſe with the old peculiar Levitical Rites. But by what Art can they evince that to be of <hi>ſpeciall right and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, which among the Levites was not of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, but of common right with the Magiſtrates and people? Indeed all Levites were born with this priviledge, to handle and touch the things of the Temple, to offer Sacrifice, to put on holy Veſtiments, to eat the holy Bread, and other things, which God expreſsly declared in his Law. The High Prieſt had a peculiar priviledge to enter into the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> to put on the holy Miter, and Breaſt-plate, which not onely was unlawfull for the people to doe; but even for the Prophets themſelves,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114151:26"/>except in ſome extraordinary caſe: but which of the high Prieſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pretence, durſt exclude out of the whole Temple, all other Prieſts; which not onely of the Magiſtrates, but even of the people themſelves, would have endured this? If under pretext of Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſineſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſacrificing, theſe Levits durſt have excluded all other Tribes, and the whole people of Iſrael, as uncleane and prophane, from all other buſineſſe of divine worſhip; they had done no leſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, then if they had caſt out of their Tents, and ſeparated from all holy men, the whole people as leprous: Therefore the Levits were to contain themſelves within the preſcript of Gods Lawes; nor were they to extend the pretext of <hi>Sanctity</hi> further then God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded. I will not for certainty affirm, that they have not been ſomtimes ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in enlarging the prerogatives of their holineſſe, as that they have not chalenged ſomewhat, never expreſly granted by God (for ambition ſeemes to be an innate evill in Church-men;) yet this I dare ſay, that the old Levits were never ſo bold, as to deny to Kings, and the whole people, many things which belonged to the worſhip and exerciſe of Religion, ſuch were; in the Temple, <hi>private and publick preaching and praying, celebrating of the Sacraments, making Lawes and Statutes of Eccleſiaſtick buſineſſe, judging and determining of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick cauſes, curbing and puniſhing Prieſts, even the high Prieſts, when they failed in their Functions:</hi> Laſtly, beſtowing power upon Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to exerciſe their holy Function, and taking the ſame away again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all which I will make cleare hereafter by examples.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>Wallachrian Iugler</hi> had weighed this well, he had not ſo boldly obtruded upon the unwary, the example of the ancient Leviticall worſhip, for maintenance of his Church-diſcipline: For he deales no otherwiſe, then if ſome contentious Fellow ſhould breake into ones Houſe, and ſhould by certain Deeds ſhew, that his Parents and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had right to ſome Benches or Stooles in that Houſe, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or bargain: whereas by the ſame Deeds it appeareth, that either the Benches were worn or demoliſhed, or elſe that the right of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, was long ſince loſt. He notwithſtanding violently ſeizeth not onely on the Benches, but likewiſe driving out the inhabitants upon the whole Houſe. Surely, whatſoever by ſpeciall right hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belonged to the Levits, and Clergy in the old Law, is now known to be aboliſhed; and whatſoever holy Functions at this day remaine, are not now peculiar to the Levits, but common to all, So that if now the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> would plead his cauſe among the Levits, they would ſhut
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114151:27"/>him out of their Synagogue. But becauſe I am to ſpeake more at large of this hereafter, I will ſay no more at preſent of the acceptions and conditions of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> till after I have touched one errour.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt obſerve that the right of ordination of <hi>holy things,</hi> belongs onely to God: If we goe beyond his preſcript, with what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext ſoever things or rites bee honoured, they are not to be accounted truly ſacred, or holy. For as all inherent ſanctity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is in God, and flowes from him: ſo likewiſe by his ſole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, things are called <hi>Relatively</hi> ſacred, or holy, in divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>From this Rule the Pope hath much deviated,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note> who by his ſole pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, by which he is lawleſſe, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Antichriſt, extolling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp;c. takes upon him liberty to ſanctifie, or as they call it, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize</hi> as he pleaſeth, <hi>Men, Places, Dayes and things;</hi> ſo that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects verily beleeve, that what hee declares to be holy, is holy indeed. Hence it is, that not being content with Jewiſh Rites, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ancient Church, doth daily deviſe new ones, which hee thinkes may conduce to his honour and profit: ſo that for a long time he hath opppreſſed Chriſtians with the inſupportable yoak of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: neither doth he this without ſome pretext of equity. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in ſome places ſtoutly affirmes, that the Pope never yet introduced any Rite, or ſacred Ceremony into the Church, which is not contained in holy Scripture. But here hee uſeth a three-fold caution: Firſt, that whatſoever frivolous interpretation the Pope giveth, muſt be held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Scripture: which cuſtome <hi>Philip Marnixius</hi> deriding, in his <hi>Bee-hive,</hi> ſhews out of <hi>Lindanus</hi> (whom he calls <hi>Blind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſinus</hi>) that there is no Rite ſo ridiculous in the Popes Hiſtrionical Church-dreſſing, for which they ſhall not find out ſome place of Scripture, out of which it is coyned, when the Popes Alchimiſticall power of interpretation is added, which can convert the frivolous droſſe of his trifles into the pure gold of Sanctity.</p>
               <p>But when he findes this way troubleſome, he uſeth this as a generall Maxime in the ſecond place, That that muſt bee counted a holy Rite and ceremony which is done with <hi>a good intention,</hi> and for <hi>a holy uſe:</hi> And as if this were not ſufficient to refute <hi>Lutherans,</hi> hee addes in the third place, That theſe things may bee held for ſacred Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which the Church judgeth to <hi>depend,</hi> and in a manner to flow from thoſe prime myſteries contained in Scripture; by which trick the Pope doth wonderfully cheat the whole world, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114151:27"/>he produceth any Novelty to oppreſſe Chriſtian Liberty, which cannot be found in Scripture, hee will have it to flow thence by way of conſequence, or by ſome connexion to depend from it. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture defines no where how this dependency may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it; hence it came to paſſe, that there was no end of <hi>ſacred dependences.</hi> For each Pope took upon him this liberty, to adde new Ceremonies to the old Rites: ſo this hath been the old Popiſh ſport multiplying new Church-ſanctities.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts walk the ſame way: For if you ask <hi>Apolonius,</hi> What he calls the ſacred Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, he will not bee content with thoſe which are directly in Gods Word, (for then there would be no uſe of legiſlative power in the Church:) but he will have thoſe things accounted for Eccleſiaſtick Rites, that are inſtituted out of a religious deſire or affection.</p>
               <p>For howſoever according to his wonted giddineſſe hee defines elſewhere this matter more preciſely,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and withall contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yet in the beginning of his work thus he deſcribes a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or ſacred Rite, <hi>That it is an action, the goodneſſe and praiſe whereof conſiſteth onely in the worſhip of God: For becauſe it is applied to divine worſhip, in order to that religious will, it hath ſufficient ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, in which the Ceremony, or holy Rite may lay its Foundation.</hi> This exactly agrees with the Popiſh intentionall Sanctity. Hee addes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>The Church muſt diligently ſearch, that according to Gods word ſhe appoint Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> But this is to bee underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Jeſuiticall phraſe and Diaſect, that Church-men onely muſt be Judges, whether ſuch or ſuch things be conſonant to Gods word, or not. It is too well known that the Romiſh Church is full of errours, and that the whole dreſſing of Papall worſhip is Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, not Apoſtolicall; yet the Jeſuites cry out, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are liers: in that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neither hath failed, nor can faile; and this they are ready to prove, if the Pope may bee Judge in his own cauſe, ſo that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can never be convinced of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, except ſhe will confeſſe her errours, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apolonius</hi> playes the <hi>Cretian</hi> not much otherwiſe. He confeſſeth that the Church cannot make Lawes in holy things, or proclaime Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but according to the Rule of Scripture: which hee doth ſo interpret, that the abſolute power of judging what is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scripture, is in the Church and Church-men. For if any Lay Magiſtrate by his Authority enquire into Eccleſiaſtick Statutes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114151:28"/>or define Eccleſiaſtick matters, or hinder Church-men from defining or making ſuch things at their pleaſure, he cries out, that this is <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, Simonaicall, and Sacrilegious:</hi> And that Lay-Magiſtrates, like ſheep, ought <hi>modeſtly to ſubmit themſelves,</hi> except the Clergie will not be <hi>reformed.</hi> And of this alſo the Clergy muſt bee Judges. For this will never agree with <hi>Apolonius</hi> his Divinity, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate ſhould bee Judge in Church-matters. Which if true, then who ſees not a way opened to theſe new Papiſts, for filling the reformed Churches with Rites and Ceremonies. Neither is there any thing more eaſie, then that theſe <hi>Bats</hi> ſhould ſtill dreame, and finde out new Rites: at which if the Magiſtrates wink, there will bee nothing ſo repugnant to Scripture, but will find aſſent and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment among the clergy; nor any Monſter ſo deformed, which they will not thruſt upon Gods people. Witneſſe the <hi>Walachran</hi> Claſſes, where a giddy-headed <hi>Baawler</hi> hath caſt out ſuch prophane and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtuffe againſt worthy <hi>Vedelius,</hi> and pious Princes. And yet <hi>if hee lye not,</hi> not onely the Conſiſtory of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> but the whole Claſſis of <hi>Wala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rhria,</hi> hath weighed, proved, and approved every thing.</p>
               <p>The other thing wherein hee reſembles Papiſts, is this: When he ſpeakes of the Church ſacred affaires, he diſtinguiſheth them into <hi>Primary, and Secundary,</hi> or dependents; where ſurkes the old my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Popery. For though Church-men have no liberty to inſtitute primary ſacred things, yet they have power to impoſe upon Chriſtians, under pain of excommunication, what by conſequence flow from the former, or ſeem to depend on them.</p>
               <p>If this bee once yeelded to <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and the <hi>Apolonian</hi> Church-Rulers, nothing will be ſo abſurd and prophane, which may not put on the ſhew and Title of holineſſe, as often as it ſhall be taught that this is an Apendix of the prime ſacred things. The matter will be cleare by an example.</p>
               <p>The prime ſacred thing in the Church, is, the preaching of the Goſpel. Hence if it be gathered, that theſe things are ſacred alſo, which neceſſarily depend from the former, doubtleſſe there will ſwarm abroad an innumerable brood of ſacred things. For there can be no preaching, except there bee ſome Preachers: Whence this neceſſarie conſequence will follow, That all Preachers, even to <hi>Apolonius,</hi> are ſacred; which I know he will not deny: For there is nothing hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for more in all this work, then to chalenge to himſelfe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114151:28"/>of ſanctity above prophane Civill Magiſtrates. But I will weave out this Web a little more.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for a Miniſter to preach without <hi>a tongue, lips, and teeth:</hi> Therefore it muſt follow, that the tongue, lips, and teeth of the Miniſter are holy.</p>
               <p>Now the tongue, lips, and teeth can frame no conception without the brain, <hi>Ergo,</hi> (except <hi>Apolinius</hi> want braines) his braines muſt bee alſo holy.</p>
               <p>The brain can performe no function if the heart <hi>quicken it not by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits:</hi> Therefore his heart and vitall ſpirits alſo, muſt bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
               <p>The brain, heart, and tongue cannot operate, except they be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Liver, Veines, and Intiſtines, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> theſe alſo in the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt be ſacred. I will not deſcend to the excrements of the body, and make them alſo ſacred by way of dependency, onely this Il'e adde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apolonius</hi> can goe no where, or ſtand to preach, without feet, whence it will follow, that his feet are alſo ſacred.</p>
               <p>Now, whereas it were immodeſt that he ſhould come to Sermon bare-footed, therefore he ought to be covered with a Cloak, Breeches, Stockins, and Shooes for the better decorum: will it not then follow, that theſe alſo are ſacred.</p>
               <p>But what if the wayes be foule, through which he walked, and goeth up to the Pulpit with dirty ſhooes? will not the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines be troubled with this <hi>quotlibeticall</hi> knot? to wit, whether the dirt and filth be not ſacred?</p>
               <p>I will not vilifie ſuch things as are truly ſacred, I purpoſe onely to explode <hi>Apolonius</hi> his idle Appendices, and ſacred conſequences, by this one example: He that will laugh at him, may make triall in other things, I will affirm this, That no ſuch liberty muſt be granted, to any man, much leſſe to a giddy-headed <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> to authorize for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and holy, whatſoever he dreames hath dependence from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie and true ſacred Rites. What miſchiefe this produced among the old Papiſts, may be ſeen by the infatuation of the people with this ridiculous and impious ſuperſtition. For not onely are Monkes holy amongſt them; but alſo by this conſequentiall inchantment, their Hands, Feet, Gownes, Hoods, are kiſſed with ſtrange veneration: ſo that it is accounted a matter of no ſmall ſanctity and merit, if one dye in a Monkes Gowne, or louſie Waſt-coat; or if a ſuperſtitious Woman wrap about her head the holy Breeches of ſome Preacher, to wit, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114151:29"/>ſhe might feele, or at leaſt worſhip the dependencies of that primary holineſſe. How-ever the matter is, I think this to be undoubtedly true, That outward Church-rites are not therefore to be held ſacred, becauſe of their order or reference to Religion and Worſhip.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of</hi> SPIRITUALITY.</head>
               <p>IT remaines, that we examine the word of SPIRITUALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE: For although both old and new Papiſts doe too much betray their owne fleſhly luſts, yet they proclaime with full Cheekes every where, their SPIRITUALITY, and make it in a manner all one with SANCTITIE, which notwithſtanding differ in this, That what is truly holy, is alwayes good; but that which is ſpirituall, is ſometime evill: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>ſpirituall wickedneſſe in the aire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I here take it in a good ſenſe, and in theſe three I make the forme of Spirituality to conſiſt: Firſt, it muſt have <hi>God for its Authour.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the end of it muſt be <hi>Gods worſhip, and the ſalvation of ſoules.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it muſt be done after a ſpirituall manner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is large in exagerating this, and ſcrapes together ſo many things out of <hi>Parker,</hi> that he who will give credit to what he prates there of Church-matters, may doubt whether <hi>Apolonius</hi> hath any fleſh yet left about him; or whether hee and his <hi>Walachrians</hi> bee not transformed into pure ſpirits long a goe. For nothing is to be found in their Church-matters, whether they bee words or things, but they muſt be accounted ſpirituall: For who is ſo meanly learned, as will ſuſpect any carnality to be left there, where ſo many Spiritualities meet together, by ſpeciall vertue of their Function and vocation. What I ſpeak is true, as is plain by the old Papiſts, where not onely by vertue of Eccleſiaſtick Calling and Office, wonderfull ſpirituality is aſcribed to the Clergy; but eſpecially when they come to the Pope, the head of their ſpirituality, ſuch is their ſuperſtition, that they think him to be,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114151:29"/>and ſo they call him a GOD, and in a manner a <hi>Meere Spirit;</hi> ſo that if he ſweare, forſweare, drink, whore; and if this Roman Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt leap from one adulterous bed to another, yet ſcarce will any bee induced to beleeve otherwiſe, but that he is holy and ſpiritual ſtill: For becauſe they think by reaſon of the dignity of his Function, that he is altogether ſanctified and Deified, they will not be eaſily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that hee can loſe his ſpirituality. This madneſſe by degrees, in Gods juſt judgements, poſſeſſed mens mindes; which leſt <hi>Apolonius</hi> ſhould renew among the Proteſtants, I will more largely explain every particular of what I have ſayd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this is moſt certain, that what hath not God, or the holy Spirit for its Authour, deſerves not the Title of <hi>Spirituality;</hi> and the more immediately and clearly any thing proceeds from Gods Spirit, ſo much the more properly is that to bee called <hi>Spirituall.</hi> For as that is called Kingly which the King immediatly doth, ſpeaketh with his own mouth, &amp; writeth with his own hand: ſo theſe things are to be eſteemed divine, holy, and ſpirituall properly, which are immediatly done by God. So Chriſts vocation and inauguration is moſt ſpirituall: For to him onely he ſpake from heaven, <hi>Thou art my Sonne:</hi> ſo God himſelfe pronounced the Law on <hi>Sinai:</hi> Such was the Apoſtles immediate voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt: ſo the word of God in Scripture, and true faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of that ſeed, are chiefly to be accounted ſpirituall. And although in things concerning faith, God uſeth the work of man, yet the effect God properly reſerveth for himſelfe, and produceth it:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> Yet this muſt not be taken ſo preciſely, but that theſe things alſo are to be reckoned ſpirituall, which God worketh by inſtruments; if ſo bee they are ſuch inſtruments as are known to bee Gods Pen-men, and Embaſſadours, ſuch as the Prophets and Apoſtles were: who as they were truly Gods Embaſſadours; ſo the things were divine, holy and ſpirituall, which God by them did ſpeake, write, and doe. Hence not only was it uſuall to the Prophets in teaching to ſay, <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord:</hi> but of ſuch Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers that is true which Chriſt ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me.</hi> For as that is called Princely which the Princes Embaſſadour doth in his name, and by his command: even ſo whatſoever the Prophets and Apoſtles, Gods immediat Embaſſadours, did or taught, is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be accounted, then if God himſelfe had ſpoken from heaven: ſo that in them was true <hi>ſpiritually.</hi> But where the gifts required for ſuch an Embaſſie ceaſe, it is certaine that there alſo ceaſeth the dignity and ſpirituality of that Embaſſie, or elſe becomes much inferiour.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114151:30"/>
               <p>Now the honour of a Divine meſſage conſiſteth in two things: Firſt, that he have a Patent, or Letters of Credence: for though one ſhould performe the Kings command, yet if he hath not this command to ſhew for his imployment, he is not to be accounted the Kings Agent, but (which ſometimes hath been done) ought to bee puniſhed as a Cheater.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is required in a Divine Meſſage, that the Meſſenger or Agent have full inſtructions of all things that concern his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he goe not beyond the bounds of his Embaſſie: he that wants either of theſe conditions, deſerves not the title of a Divine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</p>
               <p>Theſe conditions were fully in the Prophets and Apoſtles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were truly Gods Embaſſadours and ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>All the Doctors of the Church at this day, come farre ſhort of this dignity, becauſe they want both theſe priviledges, as I will afterward ſhew. Hence appeares the Popes falſhood, who though hee hath no Letters of Credence to ſhew for his employment, by reaſon of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſity of his Calling, who almoſt like a Thiefe, creeps in at the back dore, and though he doth ſo performe his Embaſſie, that he goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Commiſſion, and tramples on it, yet he bragges with ſuch boldneſſe, that he is Chriſts Embaſſadour, that not content with this Title, will be called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Biſhop, and Head of the Church:</hi> yea, <hi>Chriſts Vicar upon Earth:</hi> by which hee ſhewes his Impudency and Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>Our new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt no leſſe boldly calls himſelfe familiarly Chriſts Embaſſadour, whereas he knowes, and ſhould acknowledge, that in performing his Maſters Embaſſie, he violates oftentimes his commands. Wee ſee alſo in his book much railing, many abſurdities, and plain falſhoods, which he thruſts upon his Readers; theſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have from his Maſter CHRIST, but rather from his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor the Pope; from whom alſo he borrowes his pride, in puffing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe up with the Title of <hi>Spirituality;</hi> ſo that not onely doth he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but in many things preferre himſelfe to the Apoſtles: For hee ſayth that the Spirituality of his Church-buſineſſe is ſuch, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate cannot attain to it; making his power over the Church ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that he will have it to be <hi>Regall,</hi> and other things of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles never dreamed, as I will more fully ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt condition of Spirituality from the Author; yet every thing is not to be called <hi>Spiritual</hi> what the Holy Spirit doth, or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114151:30"/>commandeth either by himſelfe, or mediatly: For ſo the workes of Creation, and all naturall things ſhould be called Spirituall; and ſo muſt all mans civill and naturall actions be called.</p>
               <p>There is then another condition required to make a thing ſpirituall; namely, that it tend to the <hi>worſhip of God, and ſalvation of ſoules:</hi> Theſe are <hi>Hope, Charity,</hi> but chiefly <hi>Faith,</hi> and its ſeed, <hi>Gods word;</hi> then the reading and preaching thereof, prayers, Sacraments, and their uſe; and whatſoever God hath appointed for his worſhip, and for begetting and ſtrengthening of Faith.</p>
               <p>And here again I will ſhew how <hi>Apolonius</hi> rageth with hatred, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe, againſt Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>The old Papiſts have perſwaded Chriſtians long ſince, that matters of ſalvation, and of holy worſhip, belong not to Princes, as being lay-men, becauſe they cannot attaine to that end; but that theſe onely belong to Church-men, as being ſpirituall: by which cunning they firſt exempted themſelves from the Civill power, and then ſubjected Lay-men and Princes to their Church, as all know.</p>
               <p>This new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt walkes upon the ſame <hi>Stilts:</hi> For hee ſayth plainly:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We think that the Civill power can never bee drawn out of its owne kind, and elivated to another end to be produced by it ſelfe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 47.49.52, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> which is not wholly naturall.</hi> He alſo every where affirmes, That the end of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is not; yea cannot, nor muſt not be, <hi>the procuring of mens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> Ye, he ſaith, it is Pelagianiſme for any to affirme, that the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, can doe any thing towards the procuring of mans ſalvation; but that he is worldly, and is to medle onely with the things of this world: As for ſalvation, it is the ſole worke of Church-men, as being ſolely ſpirituall. In this hee doth not onely play the Papiſt in removing godly Magiſtrates ſo farre from this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end in procuring ſalvation, but alſo openly reſiſteth the truth which he might have learned out of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calv.</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</note> who compares Magiſtrates to the earth, and plainly ſayth, that the propagation of Religion depends no otherwiſe from them, then the <hi>producing of Corn from the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now every one knowes, that the end and proper effect of the earth is to produce corne; ſo that he who will now perſwade us, that the earth brings not forth corne, and that it conferres nothing to this producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that this production is no wayes the end or effect of the earth, will make himſelfe ridiculous to Husband-men and Children. Yet that is not made Spirituall, whatſoever by Conſequences depends
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114151:31"/>upon this end, or by winding or doubtfull wayes tend to this end.</p>
               <p>We ſee this conſequentiall dependencie of ſpirituall things, to have been under the Leviticall Prieſthood: The Temple was holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; from this flowed the Spirituality of the Levites which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Temple: From their ſpirituality came the ſpirituality of their garments, and of the Temples utenſils; and laſtly, the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things which were made ſacred, becauſe they ſerved for the worſhip in the Temple: which though according to Gods preſcript, they were thus accounted, I doubt not but the ſucceeding Levites ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many things to increaſe their Spirituality, which wee know were not of the ſame eſteem.</p>
               <p>The old Papiſts in multiplying of ſpiritualities, did not onely imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but alſo in many things exceed the Levites: ſo that among them not onely is that ſpirituall, which immediatly and primarily tends to the end of ſalvation and worſhip, but whatſoever alſo hath reference to this end, though a-farre off, is in a manner honored with the ſame priviledge of Spirituality by them. For example.</p>
               <p>The Pope with them is moſt ſpirituall: Hence whatſoever hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Pope, as to the end, is alſo ſpiritual. So his Crown, Keyes, Cloake, Shooes, Hoſe Conclave, Servants; yea, almoſt his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, Mules and Aſſes, are accounted for holy and ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>The Maſſe with them is chiefly ſpirituall: From this, every thing that hath relation to it, as to the end, is alſo ſpirituall: Such are the Place, Challice, Water-Box, Altar, Veile, Pictures, Gifts, Prieſt, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and whatſoever hath reference to this end, though never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts are yet ſitting upon their egges of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality; if their Chickens be well hatched, we ſhall have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brood of Spiritualities: at this day theſe are reckoned for ſpirituals, at leaſt not to be touched to wit, right to preach and pray publickly, to adminiſter the Sacraments, to cenſure, to call, to make Church-laws; the right of Synods and Dependencies: and (which <hi>Apolonius</hi> lately hath hatched) the power of collecting and diſtributing of Almes: of each whereof, I will hereafter ſpeak. This is ſure, that whatſoever God hath appointed for the ſalvation of ſoules, is ſpirituall; but if it bee collected from hence, that all theſe things are ſpirituall which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to this, as to the principall end, there will ariſe a million of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities. As if one would ſay, the Bread in the Sacrament is ſpirituall,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114151:31"/>becauſe ordained by Chriſt for a ſpirituall uſe: Hence ſome curious Caviller ſhould doubt, whether the Wheat of which the bread is made, was not alſo ſpirituall? Whether the Meale, the Baker, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Servant, and Basket in which that bread was carried to the Conſiſtory, or whether the Keeper of it, or Diſh in which the Bread lay on the Table, be not all ſpiritual? For this vain Arguer will proceed the ſame way that <hi>Apolonius</hi> doth, who faith that the uſe of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſacred and ſpirituall, becauſe of Chriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ination and end, will conclude that he alſo is eminently ſpirituall above all Preachers, Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, Doctors of Divinity, Elders and Deacons; becauſe hee thinkes that by ſpeciall right he may take that bread, breake and diſtribute it. If this intention of ſpirituality ariſeth from the vicinity of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end; then either ſome new <hi>Scotus</hi> muſt ariſe for theſe <hi>Walachrians,</hi> or elſe <hi>Apolonius</hi> muſt be endowed with the Seraphicall Spirit of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that he may unfold the <hi>quotlibeticall</hi> trifles which will ariſe in <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachria,</hi> concerning the beginning, end, and degrees of Spiritualities; an example of which I give in the Sacramentall bread: for ſome will ask, When will that Bread in the Supper firſt become ſpirituall? Whether then when it is carried into the Conſiſtory? But ſo the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets Boy ſhould be ſpirituall, or elſe he ſhall prophane holy things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he toucheth that Bread. Or is it then firſt, when the Preachers being ſolemnly aſſembled in the Conſiſtory, they firſt taſt the bread and wine, to try whether it is made of good Corne, and of a good reliſh.</p>
               <p>And give me leave here to report what I heare of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Divines, whoſe cuſtome is to meet the day before the Sacrament, in their Conſiſtory, where they taſt of the Loaves which are to be uſed in the Supper: But becauſe that dry ſpirituality would chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them, and ſo ſtop their preaching ſpirit, the wine of the Supper is brought; by taſting of which, that dry ſpirituality is moiſtned. This alſo is boldly reported, that the Paſtor and his Elders in that ſpiritual Claſſis, have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo largely of the Wine the day before, that there was none left for the next day; and that the Preacher, with his Elders, were ſcarce in eaſe to adminiſter the Supper. But I reject this as a Fable; for my part I doe not think that <hi>Apolonius</hi> will confeſſe that bread to be ſpirituall, though it be made by taſting, ſomewhat neerer to the Supper, becauſe the Keeper of it muſt be ſpirituall, or elſe there would be a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of holy things: For hee with his wife doubtleſſe, is as nimble to taſt the bread before, as the Preachers themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:114151:32"/>
               <p>I ask further, Whether then it become ſpirituall when it is put upon the Table for the Supper? becauſe then it is much neerer to its end.</p>
               <p>But here again an abſurdity will ariſe: the Keeper ought to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſpirituall,, or elſe he ſhall prophane ſacred things, becauſe he brings the bread and toucheth it when he puts it on the Table. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines therefore that onely then the bread becomes ſpirituall, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonius</hi> toucheth and breaketh it: for then it ſeemes to bee neereſt to its end.</p>
               <p>But now again there wil ariſe a new Catalogue of <hi>quotlibets:</hi> for out of the propinquity of the principall ſanctity which is in the bread, there will ariſe divers degrees of ſpiritualities: for the neerer that every part toucheth that ſpirituall end, ſo much the neerer it is to ſpirituality; and therefore becauſe of the object becomes more ſpirituall. So that now it is plain, that neither <hi>Apolonius</hi> his feet, nor legges, nay, nor his ſhoulders nor head, are in holineſſe to be compared to his hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not they, but theſe alone doe immediatly touch that ſpirituall object.</p>
               <p>But if one will argue more ſubtilly, he will ſay, that not all the hand is equally ſpirituall, but the ſinger poynts, by which the bread is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and broken, are more ſpirituall then the reſt: and becauſe the skin doth moſt of all immediatly touch the bread, it will follow that this is the moſt ſpirituall of all the parts; but the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> or <hi>Epidermis</hi> doth touch yet more immediatly, except this little skin be loſt by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſo perhaps is covered with gloves, then ſure the Leather which immediatly toucheth the bread, muſt have moſt ſpirituality. Therefore <hi>Apolonius</hi> cannot be ſo ignorant of quodlibeticall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, but muſt needs perceive that out of this finall objective ſpirituality, by reaſon of the divers degrees of vicinity, that there are divers degrees of ſpirituality in that which medleth with the object. The ſolution of theſe Riddles, if <hi>Apolonius</hi> can bring out of Divinity, let him; but I to leave theſe trifles, ſay, that there is a third thing required to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is the <hi>Mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Though that onely is to be called ſpiritual which hath God or the holy Ghoſt for its Authour, whether mediatly or immediatly; and which properly is ordained, and tendeth to Gods worſhip, and ſaving of ſoules, yet we can explain rightly how much one thing or perſon is more ſpiritual then another; but it is by the <hi>Manner,</hi> whereby we ſee more or leſſe ſparkles of ſpiritual light: for as he is moſt Princely,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114151:32"/>on whom the Prince doth beſtow moſt favours and badges of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: So he is moſt ſpirituall, in whom ſhines moſt the dignitie and holineſſe of the Spirit: Which is apparent in the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, of whom no body doubts, but that they exceeded all others in the priviledge of ſpirituality: But this alſo was evident in them, becauſe they were chiefly furniſhed with ſpiritual gifts by Chriſt: For they were truly his Embaſſadours. It were an abſurd thing, if the King ſhould ſend an Embaſſadour abroad, &amp; not furniſh him with ſuch things as are requiſite for his Embaſſie: even ſo had it been diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God, to have Embaſſadours not qualified with all ſpiritual gifts, Whence we may ſee the difference between the Levits &amp; the Prophets: For they being ordained for the ordinary ſervice of the Prieſthood, had only outward ſanctity: they wanted oftentimes the inwards, gifts of holineſſe, and of the Spirit: For they were wicked ignorant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, neither did they any miraculous thing: The high Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gave Oracles by Urim and Thummim; but this depended rather from the Breaſt-plate, Ark, and Propitiatory, then from the High Prieſt himſelfe. It was otherwiſe in the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: for they were ſent from GOD, <hi>Not from Men, nor by Men,</hi> and that by a moſt ſpirituall Vocation. Whence they were highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt: For their life was holy, their Doctrine and Writings i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fallible; and they excelled in the power of Miracles. Laſtly, there were none then in the Church except ſuch as maliciouſly ſhut their eyes, who did not ſee that they were truly ſpirituall, and Chriſts Legates: So that the Title of Spirituality did moſt properly belong to them: which conditions ceaſed upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles departure.</p>
               <p>From hence again appeares the impudence of the old Papiſts, who ſo proudly bragge of their Spirituality, and yet have never a Badge of the Spirit in them, as we may ſee in the Pope, who is the Epitome of all Romiſh Spirituality; who, as it is well known not onely frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently, poſſeſſeth his ſpiritual Chaire; but is alſo deſtitute of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts: For his life is impious, and his Doctrine falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Laſtly, he doth no miracle, but is himſelfe a Miracle, and wonder, to the world in reſpect of his pride and wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian Papiſt</hi> wrote this whole Booke of his owne Spirituality, and of the Magiſtrates Carnality; and almoſt in every third page he calls himſelfe Chriſts Legat, and bragges of his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; which pride he learned from Antichriſt his predeceſſor, having
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114151:33"/>the Jeſuits for his only Maſters, whence I can eaſily convince him of the like impudence.</p>
               <p>For to ſay nothing of the Spirituality of his vocation, which is now truly humane; let him tell us, where are now the Badges of his ſpiritual and Apoſtolick Embaſſie? For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that they are <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> not <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> who are <hi>contentious, and puffed up:</hi> but what vice more familiar among the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Miniſters? which appeares by this one writing of <hi>Apolonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Elſe-where <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that they are carnall who <hi>know not</hi> the Word of God. The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſeemes to have gone through humane Writings with old Papiſts, but he never laboured with <hi>Apollos</hi> to be powerfull in the holy Scriptures. Laſtly, he affirmes this of the lives of Modern Miniſters, that they are very foully ſpotted; but this hee doth not much regard, onely he upbraids <hi>Vedelius</hi> with this, that Profeſſors alſo defile their Doctoral Function with feaſting and drunkenneſſe.</p>
               <p>The fallibility of Doctrine imitates the ſpotted life of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: For all are forced to confeſſe, that their preaching word is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; with which Badge of Embaſſie the Apoſtles were chiefly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe they preached and wrote <hi>infallibly,</hi> All of them prate much of this thing, as the Pope uſeth to doe; but experience ſhewes the contrary.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they are all deſtitute of the gifts of Miracles, in which chiefly <hi>Apoſtolicall Spirituality</hi> did ſhine: ſo that in this power they exceeded all others: But I doe not think that it was ever found yet, that at the prayers of <hi>Apolonius</hi> the Church did ſhake, or that lying <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphyra did fall down dead.</hi> It is not unlikely, if he had the power or ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> to bring down fire from heaven, but he would doe it, and burn up all his Magiſtrates, though there were fifty of them, ſuch is his heat againſt them.</p>
               <p>This Il'e ſay briefly, That Chriſt is too rich a King of <hi>Spirituall gifts,</hi> to imploy ſuch poore and naked Embaſſadours as theſe, who have no Badge or mark of his Embaſſie, except you'l call him the Kings Embaſſadour, who taking upon him the name of an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, but wanting Letters of Credence, and have nothing to ſhew for his Commiſſion, wil in a tumultuous way proclaime the Kings Lawes, and in the mean while tranſgreſſe the Lawes, and for his owne benefit oppoſe and mock the King.</p>
               <p>What I have ſayd of <hi>Perſons,</hi> may be obſerved of <hi>Things,</hi> to wit, that there are divers degrees of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> according to the <hi>Manner;</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:114151:33"/>ſo that in this regard a thing is more <hi>holy and ſpirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be ſeen in the Jewiſh Church-government, as in a type, the Ark, Propitiatory, Breaſt-plate, Cherubim, and other things that were kept in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> were moſt ſacred and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, becauſe in them God was in a manner immediatly. There was leſſe ſpirituality in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which contained theſe things: Inferiour to this was the Holy Place, whither all the Prieſts came; and yet more inferiour was the outward Court, whither all the people repaired; then, Mount Zion, on which ſtood the Temple; and at laſt Jeruſalem, within which all theſe were incloſed. All theſe had not the ſame ſanctity; but in many degrees different; and he had playd the Impoſtor, who under the Title of a general ſpirituality, had made all holineſſe equal, and promiſcuouſly removed all from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places.</p>
               <p>Now though the Leviticall worſhip be aboliſhed, and external or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spirituality, yet this remaines in Chriſtian worſhip and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline, that there is not the ſame degree of Spirituality, but much different in the <hi>Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods word is moſt ſpiritual, which moſt plainly favours of the Holy Ghoſt its Authour, as being properly ordained for ſaving of ſoules: Hence it is moſt true, that all things found in this for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are moſt ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>To this is next <hi>true Faith,</hi> which proceeding from this ſeed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſavours of Spirituality, and in whom it is found, him it makes ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Inferiour to theſe, are <hi>Hope, Charity, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which borrow their ſpirituality from it:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>For without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> and conſequently to be truly ſpiritual: They differ alſo in this; for theſe are common to Hypocrites and wicked men: ſo is not Faith.</p>
               <p>Inferiour to theſe are the outward meanes of begetting faith, and other vertues in us: ſuch are <hi>Reading and preaching of the Word, and adminiſtration of Sacraments:</hi> which have this prerogative of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, that they are the proper meanes to conferre ſalvation; and to conſtitute a Church: yet theſe are much inferiour in dignity to <hi>Gods word,</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> For theſe are of themſelves, and alwayes ſpiritual; but thoſe are onely ſpiritual actions, ſo farre as they are converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the others, as their ſpiritual objects; but chiefly if they be in a lawful and ſpiritual way.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:114151:34"/>
               <p>Laſtly, theſe things are inferiour in degree, which in the Church-Diſcipline belong onely to the wel-being or properly which remove the evil being that may ariſe from confuſion and ſcandal: ſuch are at this day the <hi>Calling</hi> of Miniſters, <hi>Diſcipline and appoynting of Lawes.</hi> All which we ſee performed and handled by wicked men. Nor are they abſolutely required to the internal form of the Church; becauſe in ſome ſort ſhe may bee without them: For ſo long doe they retaine ſpirituality, as they doe exactly anſwer the Rules of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially ſo long as they carry plainly the markes and Badges of the Holy Ghoſt, as was in the time of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I have briefly touched the differences and degrees of Spiritualitie, that I might reſiſt the fraud of Popery. For it was very familiar with old Papiſts, to confound all the degrees of Spiritualitie, and principally to vent for chiefe ſpiritual things, their owne buſineſſe and actions, which they performe about theſe properly ſpirituall things: For they deſpiſe Gods word, which is moſt ſpiritual, and their onely contention is of the right of handling this Word: whence they arrogate power and command to themſelves: So they make ſmall account of <hi>true Faith, and truly faithfull men,</hi> which indeed are truly ſpiritual; but their main ſtrife is, about the right of ruling, puniſhing, and cenſuring thoſe ſpiritual men: and in this they place all ſpiritualitie; ſo that to themſelves alone they claime the right of Spirituality, and exclude all Chriſtians as Lay-men, and not ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt with them keeps equal pace: For hee doth not place properly ſpirituality in Gods Word, in true Faith, and other things truly ſpiritual: For hee knowes that theſe are common to all Chriſtians; but hee ſeekes all the pretext of ſpirituality in <hi>Actions</hi> which are imployed about theſe things, eſpecially in ſuch as hee thinks belong onely to him, and ſuch as he is: In whom although <hi>(as they are now)</hi> there is much carnality, but very little ſpirituality, yet hee croakes ſo proudly of theſe actions, and of the right of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, as if the whole ſumme or higheſt pitch of ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie conſiſted in them, whoſe Plea is all one, as if a Levit of old had compared the ſanctity of the outward Court, or of Mount Sion, to the dignities of the Holy of Holies, or Ark within it: For as to theſe the other were ordained; ſo alſo from theſe they received all their dignity of holineſſe.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:114151:34"/>
               <p>But let this premonition ſuffice concerning the acceptions of <hi>Church, Spirituality</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> which in the following diſcourſe I wil handle more at large.</p>

               <p>HItherto I have delineated the acceptions of theſe words, CHURCH, SANCTITIE, and SPIRITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALITIE, under which Cloakes the old Papiſts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore have, and the new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts now doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare and delude the unwary: the ſumme of which was, that cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourouſly they bragge of the vertues and ſanctity of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>Catholick Church and Inviſible;</hi> which doubtleſſe is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Spirituall:</hi> But when they come to the matter, they turne aſide to viſible and particular Churches, which oftentimes differ as much in holineſſe and ſpirituality, as the Kings Cloſet doth in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from a Swines-ſtigh: For this abounds with hypocrites, ſinners, and prophane wretches.</p>
               <p>Again, when they boaſt of the vertues of the viſible Church, they handle the matter as if they pleaded for the univerſall Church,

               <p>Laſtly, they doe ſo prate of ſpiritualities, and the holineſſe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Rulers, that they ſtay not upon the commendations of

               <p>This priviledge of <hi>Sanctity</hi> by the worlds fatall errour, hee hath now long poſſeſſed, and I feare will poſſeſſe to the end of the World. For though the Chriſtian World ſhould happen to bee freed of this firſt Antichriſt, yet we ſee by what is ſayd, a new Antichriſtian ſeed ſpringing out of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> who to the great diſgrace of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, doth dawb over with the ſtrange painting of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> the buſineſſe of the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> yet with this caution, That he will have us beleeve, that it reſides not in the whole body, but onely in the Miniſters, as the Captaines and Preſidents thereof.</p>
               <p>This Fiction having taken impreſſion, there is ariſen among Church men ſuch a pride of preheminence, that there is none of them, though never ſo baſely born, though promoted to the Pulpit by never ſo wicked meanes, but thinkes himſelfe in Church-matters exempted from all obedience to the Magiſtrate, and that he is to rule: them all. Which Pride, if at length (as is ſeen in the <hi>Walachian</hi>

               <p>The firſt of theſe ſhould be the publick reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<note place="margin">Ectypon.</note> For ſince it pleaſed God to comprehend the counterfeit of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth in writing, he never granted ſo much to vocall preaching, as not to have it examined and weighed in this balance of Scripture; So that neither Prophets nor Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 5.</note> nor Chriſt himſelfe were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.</note> Hence not onely the reading of holy Scriptures in private, hath been familiar with all good men, but alſo among the publick Functions of the Church, it hath been a ſolemne cuſtome to read the Law, that is, the Scripture; ſo that the chiefeſt men have not ſcorned to performe this duty ſometimes.</p>
               <p>That place <hi>Acts</hi> 13.14. is worth the noting;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16.</note> and chiefly that of <hi>Luke,</hi> where it is ſayd, that Chriſt being at Nazareth on the Sabbath day, <hi>roſe up, and having taken the Booke, did read that famous place in Eſay</hi> 61.1. So that this task was performed by the beſt men, and not put over to the meaner ſort, as now: For at this day the holy Scripture is to be eſteemed no leſſe then Vrim and Thummim of old among the Jewes, and the Sanctuary where God gave his Oracles. For as ſoon as he gave off to deliver his Oracles there, and ceaſed to ſend Prophets, by whom he ſpake extraordinarily, they had nothing certain but the Law and the Teſtimony; that is, the Scripture, with which they ought to conſult.</p>
               <p>The Pope at this day utters many lies concerning his infallible power of deciding controverſies. The new reformed Papiſts truſting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114151:36"/>to their infallibility, will have men beleeve their interpretations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of excommunication, and danger of hell fire. But this ſhould be known among Chriſtians, that now nothing is infallible, except the Scripture alone; which if we had not, there ſhould bee no certainty in divine worſhip or religion at all.</p>
               <p>Surely, ſuch is the uſe and efficacie of reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is knowne by experience of all Ages, that in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many have been converted and ſaved onely by reading; which the Pope, Chriſts adverſary, the fatall tyrant of Chriſts Church, knew too well, who in the firſt beginning of Reformation, that he might ſtop the courſe of the Goſpel, inhibited the <hi>reading of Scripture,</hi> under pain of death; but withall giving leave to preach: For he knew that by the dumb and ſecret help of reading, many were ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that not onely thence got they knowledge and boldneſſe to tax his errours, but alſo to confeſſe the truth in the midſt of flames and tortures.</p>
               <p>Neither here doe I much regard <hi>Stapletons</hi> cavill, that men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by bare reading be converted,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> becauſe it is ſayd, <hi>How can they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve of whom they have not heard? How can they heare without a Preacher?</hi> Alſo <hi>Faith comes by hearing:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from faith and ſalvation, ſuch as are corporally deafe, for that they cannot heare; but in expreſſing the one ſenſe of hearing, he hath not excluded the other. Beſides, faith comes by hearing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick or privat reading. Therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> warned the godly, that they pray often, and read the Scripture. <hi>For when we pray</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>we ſpeak to God; when we read, God ſpeaks again to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt holy Eccleſiaſtick meanes then to beget and preſerve faith, in us, is the reading of the Scripture, and it is ſo much the more excellent, in that it is not ſubject to the will or command of any man, but moſt purely conveyes to us the liquor of divine Truth, as it were out of a Fountaine of ſuch uncorrupted ſincerity, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ſacred Function alone, Chriſt commanded to heare the Scribes and Phariſees in all that they ſhall ſay. But <hi>Apolonius</hi> doth not much ſtrive about this ſpirituality and priviledge, becauſe there is in it nothing imperious, but ſervile rather: not would hee cry out that his ſacred things were prophaned, if perhaps the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould uſe this office of reading; but would rather ſay, that it is a teſtimony of civil ſervitude, no otherwiſe then of old the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>

               <p>Next to reading is preaching. <hi>Stapleton</hi> and the Jeſuites are ſo proud of the priviledge of this Function, that they claim a power to themſelves to ſave ſouls, for thus they reaſon: <hi>No man can be ſaved without faith, no man can have faith without hearing Gods word, no man can heare without a Preacher, no man can preach, except he be ſent. to ſend belongs onely to the Governours of the Church: Therefore they conclude, That the care and power of ſaving depends on them.</hi> By which Title they inſult over all, as if they were lay men, if they offer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more narrowly of matters of ſalvation, as if the buſineſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did not belong to ſuch.</p>
               <p>This errour <hi>Apotonins</hi> breathes every where, uſing almoſt the ſame weapons that the Jeſuites doe, to wit, that modern preaching is the ſanctified and ſpirituall meanes, and by ſpirituall right Eccleſiaſtick, belonging onely to Miniſters by their right of Vocation: But for others, eſpecially for worldly Magiſtrates, it is neither lawfull nor poſſible.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that preaching is in ſome fort holy and uſefull for the Church; but hee that will compare the manner of it as it is at this day, with that of the Apoſtles, he will compare the ſhadow with the body: for they were truly inſpired by God, and taught by God, furniſhed with all the gifts of Knowledge, Tongues, Miracles, by Divine authority, as Chriſts Embaſſadours, they preached and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpenſed the Myſteries of God, God ſpeaking by them, and therefore they abſtained from all pleaſing allurements of Arts, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections. But at this day whaſoever declamatory Art is in preaching, it proceedes of humane and ſecular precepts, with that pomp, that now nothing in the Church is thought handſous, but what ſavours of <hi>Quintilians</hi> Tropes, or of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Metaphyſicks. This is no new thing: for ſhortly after the Apoſtles departure, the ſubtilties of Philoſophers, unknown to the Apoſtles, were made uſe of to edifie the Church withall, but with this ſucceſſe, that theſe Arts brought more darkneſſe then light into the Church: for they layd the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many errours, and chiefly of Antichriſtianiſme then ſpringing up. Which humane Artifices are now vented with ſuch pride, that all the Majeſty of Gods word conſiſting in ſimplicity, is by them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured: For although there is ſome uſe of theſe Arts againſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors of the truth, yet we know by experience, that more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114151:37"/>differences and errours are raiſed then aboliſhed by them: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Church ever fight with better ſucceſſe, then when the adverſaries were confuted with pure Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now if there be ſuch failings in their vertues, what ſhall we ſay of their vices? We find by experience, that they are deſtitute often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of all things requiſite by <hi>Paul</hi> in a Biſhop; and being armed with impudent Fore-heads (as we ſee in <hi>Apolonius</hi>) they ruſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this work with ſuch pride, that they make themſelves ſpirituall, holy, Chriſts Legats, and in a manner the Apoſtles fellows; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they labour not alwayes to furniſh the pure milk of Gods Word, but rather to vent their own affections, inventions, and fictions, and that with ſuch eagerneſſe and quarrelling, that they can ſcarce ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from railing. Though theſe things were mended according to the manner and example of the Apoſtles, yet I would ſay that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> is ſwelled with Antichrian pride, and ſo are all our new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who place more holineſſe, and ſpeciall ſpirituality in their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching work, then was ever held of old under the Levitical law, or after under the Apoſtles. For albeit that all were debarred from ſacrificing except the Levits, yet no man was hindered from preaching, neither Princes nor Lay-people: <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David Solomon,</hi> and other Princes did preach publickly: When <hi>Joſaphat, Joſiah,</hi> and other Kings reſtored the worſhip of God, they ſent <hi>Prieſts Levits</hi> to teach, and ſo they did likewiſe Lay-men. When Religion was reſtored under <hi>Nehemiah, Eſdras</hi> and the Levits taught; but it is added, that <hi>Inſhua,</hi> and ſome of the people did publickly read and teach.</p>
               <p>If this was of ſuch ſpeciall right, as the Eccleſiaſtick and Leviticall Office of ſacrificing, entring into the Sanctuary, ſeparating and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of Lepers, and other things which God granted to the Prieſts and Levits: why was it ſo promicuouſly granted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Who will not ſay that the Levits and Apoſtles were irreligious, and tramplers upon their owne holy Function, in giving leave ſo promiſcuouſly for men to preach, that they hindered no man from it either publickly or privatly, if hee was apt. This may bee ſhewed by many examples:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46.</note> Firſt, when CHRIST being about twelve yeares of age, diſputed publickly in the Temple with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: For though he might juſtly doe this, having a Divine calling thereto, yet the Scribes and Phariſees knew not ſo much: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were too proud of the priviledge of their Chaire, and of preaching, to ſuffer any, much leſſe a child, to meddle with their

Whence I gather, that then there was no ſuch need of writings to ſhew their Orders and Callings to preach; but any man might preach that was apt. For it is moſt certain, that Chriſt had no ordinary vocation: without which if it had been then ſo ſacrilegious a thing to preach, as <hi>Apolonius</hi> would now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, doubtleſſe they had pulled Chriſt out of the Pulpit, whom the Scribes and Phariſees would not acknowledge for an extraordinary Prophet.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Apolonius</hi> in ſome places ſhewes at large, that <hi>Paul</hi> was known there: For out of his ſingular skill in Scripture he thinkes that this was <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> where hee was well known: But hee is ſhamefully deceived, and feeds his Reader with falſhoods. For <hi>Luke</hi> expreſsly ſayth, that this was not <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> but of <hi>Piſidia</hi> where hee was not yet knowne: for that lyeth in <hi>Syria,</hi> over againſt <hi>Cyprus,</hi> about the Bay of <hi>Iſſicum,</hi> by the river <hi>Orontes:</hi> But this of <hi>Piſidia</hi> was over againſt <hi>Attalia,</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and is diſtant in longitude from the other, at leaſt an hundred miles: Hee is then as much deceived, as if he had confounded <hi>Lyons</hi> with <hi>Leyden:</hi> which errour is ſo plain, that children may find it out; and ſurely it is not to be ſuffered in a man ſo higly puffed up and preſumptuous, who like a Scribe, or Phariſee, durſt preſcribe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> what they thought of doubtfull and abſtruſe things, when he ſaw not that which was before his feet.

               <p>This caſe alſo is notable, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.20. that certaine <hi>Cyprians</hi> and Diſciples of <hi>Cyrone,</hi> being diſperſed by the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> preached to the <hi>Greekes</hi> at <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe things being thus performed by the Apoſtles, doe agree with the ordinary inſtitution of teaching in the Church; which was, that every one that was apt, might have leave to teach and propheſie in the Church, ſo it be done orderly, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another; onely women were to bee debarred from this exerciſe for the better decorum. Whence it is cleare, that under theſe great divinely-inſpired Rulers of the Church, the myſtery of preaching was not of ſuch ſpeciall right and ſpirituality, as the <hi>Treverian Stilt-walker,</hi> with the Papiſts, would make us beleeve.</p>
               <p>But by a pretty cavill he would faine eſcape: For he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between <hi>Charitable</hi> or <hi>Edifying</hi> preaching (as hee calls it) and <hi>powerfull,</hi> or <hi>poteſtative, which is with the power of the Keyes, and of Gods Legats:</hi> that ſayth he, is lawfull for all, this onely for Miniſters, as Gods Legats.</p>
               <p>This invention of his, though childiſh, yet I will diſcuſſe at large, becauſe the buſineſſe here agitate, is not of Goats-wooll, but of greateſt authority in the World; under pretence, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of which, our moderne Preachers ſpue out their railings and reproaches againſt Princes, States, and their owne Magiſtrates: and the Pope hath by this, ſubdued the whole world; whom the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> imitating, doth oftentimes urge, that he is Chriſts Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſedour to the people: By which he aſſumes ſuch power to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he thinkes he preacheth with the ſame authority that Gods Meſſengers did; ſo that he who heares him, heares Chriſt; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects him, rejects Chriſt. With which vizard if he deceive Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Pope hath done: it will bee an eaſie matter for him to babble out his dreames, and the affections or fooleries of his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered minde, in ſtead of Oracles.

               <p>I grant firſt, that Chriſts true Legat hath very great priviledges, and that his Authority is ſuch, that wee muſt obey him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then Chriſt himſelfe: But I deny this to belong to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Preachers, though never ſo godly, much leſſe to the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi>

                  <q>God commands <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the Churches Suffrages, to be ſent abroad, to that he had ordained them: Hence we collect, That there is no lawfull election of Paſtors, but where God hath the chiefeſt voyce. For, in that he hath commanded the Church to chuſe Paſtors and Biſhops, he hath not permitted ſo much liberty to men, as not to be chiefe Preſident and Moderator himſelfe. Indeed this ordinary election of Paſtors, differs from that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> becauſe it was behoofefull that they who were to bee the Apoſtles of the Gentiles, ſhould be deſigned by divine Oracle, which was not needfull to be done daily in the ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: only this is common to both, that as God witneſſed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be ordained particularly by him to preach the Goſpel, even ſo none ought to be called to teach, but ſuch as God hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in ſome ſort choſen himſelfe.

If this cheating <hi>Walachrian</hi> be not thus puniſhed here, let him be aſſured he ſhall be puniſhed hereafter by Chriſt, the Title of whoſe Embaſſie he ſo contumeliouſly abuſeth; as in other things, ſo in the Popes fictions he is fleſhed and hardned; to wit, that it is in Divine and Eccleſiaſticall Callings, as in Civill, that they who have may have, and who poſſeſſe, may poſſeſſe; that is, if any as fit for an Office as an Aſſe for a Harp, yet being choſen and imployed by the Prince, acquites this right from God, that hee muſt bee acknowledged for the Princes Legat, and muſt be obeyed no otherwiſe then the Prince himſelfe: And thus doth the Pope eſteeme of his Offices.</p>
               <p>But we have now ſeen, that God acknowledgeth no man for his Embaſſadour, but he whom he hath firſt called, and then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently gifted: Which being wanting in the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> wee need not doubt, but that the Church in chooſing him, was deceived through Ignorante; but he ſinnes doubly and maliciouſly, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of gifts, dare bragge himſelfe to bee CHRISTS Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, and in a higher ſtrain then the Church could be her election af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him.</p>
               <p>Next to preaching, is the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which at this day is held ſo holy, and in a ſpeciall manner Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, that from it, as from a Sanctuary, they keep off Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents endowed with the gift of Preaching: Which ſpeciall ſanctity is not taken out of Gods Word, but firſt coyned in Antichriſts Shop, and by an indelible contagion, is crept upon our Churches; in which, as men doe moſt ſmell of Popiſh Garlicke, ſo they extoll it, as we ſee in the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> who having crawled through the Papiſts Dunghill more diligently then others he cries out, that this part of his Church-furniture, is in ſuch a ſpeciall manner holy, as that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall Office of ſacrificing, was not more. But he is much deceived. For under the Levits the right of circumciſing was in common, and not proper to the Levites: they killed and ate the Paſſeover when no
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114151:40"/>Levit was preſent.

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</note> In the New Teſtament Chriſts Diſciples are ſaid to baptize without any difference: <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſſe and plain tearmes ſayth, that he was not ſent to baptize, and rejoyced that hee had not baptized many of them. The Apoſtles laying aſide the Deacons Office, did claime to themſelves the Function of praying and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; but never a word of Baptiſme, or adminiſtration of the Supper.</p>
               <p>Neither hath this any ſhew of truth, which commonly they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. did joyne preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by an indiſſoluble knot: For I ask, To what preaching did Chriſt tye Baptiſme? Whether to the Apoſtolicall alone, which hee there ſolemnly inſtituted, or ſimply to publick preaching? If to the former, then our modern Preachers are too blame, in that they preach not Apoſtolically, and yet challenge the ſpeciall right of baptizing out of this place; but if to this, they offend in taking away the right of preaching from Proponents and publick Preachers.</p>
               <p>And whreas wee have proved, that God hath debarred no man from publick preaching, if he be gifted, it followeth, that the right of baptizing doth not belong to Church-Preachers alone <hi>Iure Divine:</hi> So that hence it is plain, that our modern Divines doe out of this place argue no otherwiſe, then if heretofore the Princes of the Jewes had ſayd, that to them alone the right of circumciſing was given by God, becauſe it was ſolemnly ſayd to Prince <hi>Ioſhua</hi> by God, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Make to thy ſelfe knives of ſtone, and circumciſe the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon is of the Supper. I confeſſe Chriſt inſtituted and celebratad the firſt Supper; but it is no where ſayd, that this was made a perpetuall Law, that no man might doe ſo, but he who is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſanctified; yea, the contrary appeares rather, in celebration of the Supper, which was then uſuall in <hi>Corinth,</hi> when as yet corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not crept in among them. For as in divers places they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to worſhip: ſo there they celebaated the Supper and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſts, ſo that the richer ſort among them brought from home their meat and drink; by which firſt the rich and poore feaſted together in common; then breaking the bread, and diſtributing it with the wine among themſelves, they did ſolemnly declare the Lords death: which ſimple way of celebrating the Supper without ceremony, ſo long as it wanted ſcandall, was never reproved by the Apoſtles, nor after, but for ſcandals and abuſes.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114151:41"/>
               <p>Whence I collect, that then ceremoniall ſanctity was not knowne among them; for want of which they ſuppoſe the Sacrament to bee prophaned, conſiſting in this, that none but the Biſhop alone, who labours in the Word, muſt conſecrate the Bread, break and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it: for it is not likely that the Biſhop was preſent in all theſe meetings; for if he had been preſent, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had not beene ſo exorbitant, as to prophane the uſe of the Supper with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and other ſinnes, or if ſuch diſorder had happened upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of their Rulers, doubtleſſe the Apoſtle had ſeverely reproved ſuch Biſhops, as the authors and fautors of all that miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>But whereas there is no foot-ſtep of any ſuch matter, it is likely that even under the Apoſtles, the Rulers were not alwayes preſent in their Churches, nor alwayes preſident at the adminiſtration of the Supper. And therefore our modern ſacramentall ſanctity of ſpeciall right, was not known to them.</p>
               <p>Hence, I ſay, that cuſtome hath conferred many things upon the Church-Rulers, which have been common among Chriſtians, for order ſake, and decency. Upon this grew the pride of the Rulers, that they challenged that to themſelves of right, which they enjoyed upon meere courteſie: whence at laſt ſprung up that violence and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which begot Antichriſt. This may bee ſeen in the Pope, who though he was ſo bountifull of Baptiſme, that hee granted it to Midwives; yet of the Supper he made an Idoll, and a Sacrifice: by whoſe myſticall Spirituality he ſo befooles the world, that upon the priviledge of beſtowing this, (which hee claimes ſolely to himſelfe) hath ſubjected to him all the Princes of the earth, too ſuperſtitiouſly fearfull.</p>
               <p>From his inſtitution ariſeth whatſoever the Moderne new Papiſts tumultuouſly ſtruggle for about the right of adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they perſwade ignorant men, that they are ſhut out of heaven, and out of the Church, if they bee debarred from the uſe of them. The right of conferring which, becauſe with tooth and naile they maintaine belongs to them alone, that by this pretence they might dominere over the ſoules and conſciences of all men; every one nill he will he, being deſirous to ſave his ſoule, is forced at laſt to fawn upon Church-men, as the guardians of ſacred things, and the arbitrators of the eternall ſalvation of ſoules.</p>
               <p>This is not much unlike the inſolency of a bold and deceitfull But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who will threaten the Caſh-keeper; yea, the Maſter of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114151:41"/>Houſe himſelfe, that he ſhall have no victuals or drinke, except hee will give him leave to put his hand in the Money-bagge as often as he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>That the great Romiſh Antichriſt by ſuch trickes hath attained to his tyranny, experience doth ſhew: That our <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is his very Ape, I have already declared, and ſhall more fully make it appeare in what followeth.

               <p>The right of preaching, praying publickly, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, is not ſo ſacred to <hi>Apolonius,</hi> as the priviledge of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, and the right of Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline, of which he bragges every where, and chiefly, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. For this he ſayth [is the ſpirituall meanes of Reformation, and juriſdiction of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eccleſiaſtick Court, the nobleſt act of which is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. He calls that a free power which is ſubject to no mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a Regall power, a ſpirituall compelling power, a ſpirituall Rod, and Sword, to which all Magiſtrates are bound to ſubmit themſelves, &amp; what is theirs.] So that none is better ſeen in the Records of the Popes Hierarchy, then this <hi>Treverian:</hi> He deſerves a Calfe of the Pope; but being not yet cleane from Grammaticall filth, hath raſhly broke in upon the ſubtilties of <hi>Scotus,</hi> or <hi>Dionyſius:</hi> for he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of <hi>Cluto, Bellarmine, Ciceſtrienſis,</hi> and other Patriarchs of his Divinity, Church-diſcipline, <hi>into the leſſer cenſure which he calls that of the Publican, of the inward Court, of the preaching Keyes, of looſing and binding, but of juridiciall, and of Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jeſuits would be glad to ſee <hi>Apolonius</hi> well knockt about the head with his monſtrous diſtinctions: hee is ſo fine and well verſed in theſe, that no <hi>Trichotomiſt</hi> can bee more acute. Although I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this Art to yeeld to the <hi>Stilt-walker;</hi> yet it will bee no hard matter this way to make out of one <hi>Apolonius,</hi> many: for I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him into a corporal and a ſpiritual <hi>Apolonius;</hi> corporall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Treverian</hi> and a <hi>Middleburgian:</hi> the <hi>Middleburgian,</hi> into a ſober and well fed one: well fed into him that feeds on ſweet meats, and him that feeds on Lobſters: on Lobſters, into him being angry, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeaſed: being angry, into him whilſt hee is writing, or whilſt hee is ſpeaking: whilſt ſpeaking, into a whiſperer, or a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: As he is a blaſphemer, I diſtinguiſh <hi>him into</hi> a Conſiſtorial, or a Church-blaſphemer: a Church-blaſphemer, into a ſtanding or a ſitting Church-blaſphemer: Again, he ſits <hi>either</hi> in the Aſſembly, or in the Pulpit, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Again, I will diſtinguiſh ſpirituall <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:114151:42"/>as he is moved by a good, or by an evill ſpirit: as hee is moved by a good ſpirit, into a young Scholar, or a Bachiler of divinity: the Bachiler of divinity into a Paſtor, or one that ſtandeth for his degree of Doctor: the Paſtor into a Preaching or a Praying Paſtor: the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſtor into a Sacramentarian and Diſciplinarian: the Diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian into an uſurper of the greater cenſure, or of the leſſer cenſure, that is, of the Keyes: and the Keyes I divide into the Miniſteriall Key and the Juridiciall Key: the Juridiciall, into that of Preaching, and that of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>And ſo we may runne <hi>in infinitm</hi> upon diſtinctions, if out of one accident, or ſmall circumſtance, we make a ſubject altogether different. I will not envie him that is at leaſure to goe on in ſuch trifles. I have in one example ſhewed his folly, and will now briefly proceed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of cenſure, and Church-diſcipline; which with him properly is of force, becauſe in it there is more authority then labour. For hee every where with the Pope his predeceſſor, ſeekes for a juriſdiction that is abſolute, ſpirituall, diſ-joyned from the worldly power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, whereby he thinks that he hath immediate power under God to cenſure as he pleaſeth, all Magiſtrates, Kings and Princes: for hee makes a twofold cenſure, the greater and the leſſer: of both which, I will ſeverally ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The leſſer cenſure is, when one for ſcandall is debarred from the uſe of the Supper, according to the will of the Miniſters; but yet that he remaine a member of the Church ſtill. That this is a meere human invention, ſhall appeare by what followes,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ask, by what divine appoyntment is he to be kept off from the Supper, who is a member of the Church, and ſo continues? Their common anſwer is, That <hi>what is holy muſt not bee given to Dogges, nor pearles caſt before ſwine.</hi> But this is a blaſphemy rather then a reaſon: For who will ſay that they are Hogges &amp; Dogges, who are yet cheriſhed in the boſome of the Church? Sure they are ſwine, who wallow in the filthy mire of wickedneſſe; and they are dogges, who barke in blaſpheming Gods worſhip. Such were the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian, Hymenaus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> delivered over to Satan.</p>
               <p>But they obtrude another Fiction to us: For they ſay, That thoſe who were polluted ceremonially under the old Law, (though they continued members of the Church) were not admitted to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ſo long as they were ceremonially polluted, and that the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114151:42"/>ſame ought to be obſerved in morall pollutions. This is frivolous and inconſequent: For the Scribes &amp; Phariſees were no leſſe curious of their ſpirituality and ſacred things, then the Moderne <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts, and yet they brought to Chriſt in the Temple, the Adultreſſe morally polluted, which if ſhe had ſtill been leprous, or ceremonially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, they had violated their ſacred worſhip. Yet the Phariſees, with the Publicanes, who were morally polluted, went up into the Temple to pray; ſo that Chriſt affirmed the Publican after prayer, to have departed cleaner from the Temple then the Phariſee,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16.</note> If there had been the ſame reaſon of morall and ceremoniall polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all theſe being morally polluted, ſhould have been debarred from ſacred things.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to bee doubted, but that God knowes beſt what belongs to his worſhip, and who are to be admitted to his holy things. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it bee certaine, that God would not ſuch as were polluted ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temonially, to come to the Temple, or to holy things; yet it is known that he would have thoſe who were morally unclean, to come to his ſacred things; without premitting any ceremoniall or penitentiary Rite, whereby they might bee firſt morally cleanſed. For they who had defiled themſelves with perfidiouſneſſe and rapine, are commanded to offer a Goat for a Sacrifice to God, ſo farre was it that they were to abſtain from ſacrificing. So in the new Teſtament we read,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.6, 7.</note> that <hi>John</hi> baptized the Souldiers, Phariſees, Sadduces, and that polluted kind of men, which he calls, <hi>Generation of vipers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, if in Gods worſhip the ſame reaſon be of thoſe that are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonially and morally polluted, why doe not the <hi>Walackrian</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, keep off likewiſe thoſe that are morally polluted, from the whole worſhip? For this is known, that it is not lawfull for Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons, either by the greater or the leſſer cenſure, to heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to give Almes, to ſee the Supper adminiſtred, to ſing Pſalmes, or to lift up their hands in prayer to God: which being well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is the moſt ſacred thing of the whole worſhip:

                     </gap>.</note> ſo that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this ſpirituall ſacrifice to bee offered by thoſe that have deans and pure hands: ſo that theſe light <hi>Walachrian</hi> Levits, are inconſtant and ridiculous in the proſtitution and preſerving of their ſacred things, in that they neglect other things, and are onely carefull that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be not polluted: the cauſe of which difference is, that they might hence have the command and dominion over men. For they perſwade the ignorant, that there is ſuch neceſſity of the Supper, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114151:43"/>is debarred from it by Church-cenſure, is in danger of eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>To this Fiction they adde another very ridiculous: That under pain of ſacriledge, none muſt give the Sacraments, but ſuch as are conſecrated by impoſition of hands, that is, Miniſters. Which Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I have already refelled: by which perſwaſion when they ſee the old Papiſts to have made themſelves Lords of the world, they ſtill hope, that by the ſame meanes they ſhall attaine the ſame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>But let us yeeld to theſe Church-Cenſures, that the caſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in thoſe that are ceremonially and morally polluted. Where have they learned, that the cleanſed as well as the polluted, are to abſtaine from holy things? The Levites indeed might keep off thoſe that were ceremonially polluted: but by the Law they were bound to abſolve them, being cleanſed. If they had ſo played in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credthings, as either not to cleanſe, or to admit to their Sacrifices, ſuch as were cleanſed, the Civill Magiſtrate might have puniſhed them. But the like reaſon is of Morall pollution, it is unfit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre thoſe from holy things, who are morally cleanſed. There were divers meanes ordained by God, by which men were expiated from Legall uncleanneſſe: But for morall impurity, wee know no other meanes to be expiated from it, but repentance, and prayer for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>This may bee ſeen in <hi>David,</hi> ſo long as he ſlept in his ſinne, and begged not for pardon, hee was uncleane; but after hee confeſſed his ſinne,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.</note> and asked pardon, <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, that God had pardoned his ſinne. So <hi>David</hi> himſelfe ſayth, that ſo long as he did not confeſſe and repent, his ſin remained; but when he confeſſed his ſin, and begged for pardon, God forgave him.</p>
               <p>God himſelfe every where hath appoynted this generall Rule: That at what time ſoever a ſinner did convert from his ſinnes, hee would not remember his former iniquities; yea, though they were as red as Scarlet and blood,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſal.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> yea upon their converſion they ſhould bee made whiter then Wooll, or Snow. Which Law <hi>Iohn</hi> repeates: If wee acknowledge our ſinnes,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</note> God is juſt and faithfull, who will cleanſe us from all unrigteouſneſſe. This Chriſt ſhewed in the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Publicans prayers: For this by confeſſing his finnes, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pardon, was forgiven and cleanſed: the other, in not confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but reckoning up his vertues, remained unclean. Which doe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114151:43"/>clearly ſhew, that they who are morally unclean, are cleanſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance alone.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes, that if a faithfull man, though grievouſly fallen, yet if he repent, and ſeek for reconciliation with God, hee is no more polluted morally, but cleane in Gods ſight. <hi>Iohn</hi> upon this onely ground baptized any that were morally polluted,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</note> if they were purged by repentance alone, and confeſſion. Why then ſhould man invade Gods right, to think him unclean whom God eſteemeth clean. Why ſhould a prating Prieſt think him unworthy of ſacred things, whom God hath not declared to be unworthy? Thus the Pope playes in holy things, that hee is not content with that Law of expiation, which to God is ſatisfactory: For ſo he ſhould loſe the profit and honour which he gets by his ſacred Juriſdiction: Therefore hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to himſelfe to judge of Chriſtians repentance, and for this cauſe preſcribes times, and penitentiary penalties; which after hee moderates by indulgences, and remits when he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>This is beleeved by fooliſh men, who think that this is done by ſpeciall priviledge: he in the meane while like a Cheater, wipes them of their money. For he impoſeth on rich men ſuch penitentiary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as he knowes will be moſt inconvenient for them. Whence oftentimes this penance is redeemed with a great fumme of money. By which Merchandice the Popes Exchequer muſt become very rich. Of this diſeaſe of Covetouſneſſe and Avarice, the Pope hath been ſo long ſick, that ſhortly after the time of <hi>Phocas,</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I doubt not but the <hi>Stile-walker</hi> is exactly skilfull in the Papall Arts, and therefore hath aſſumed to himſelfe, as a ſpeciall priviledge, the right of excluding Chriſtians from the Supper, and of appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time how long they ſhall forbeare; hoping alſo that by this cunning hee may procure of the richer ſort of Chriſtians, who will bee impatient to forbeare long, either money or elſe good cheere, or the promiſe of ſome Office, or ſome other kind of gratification. How ever hee may either enjoy or bee fruſtrated of his hopes, wiſe Chriſtians, and honeſt-hearted Magiſtrates ought to be aſſured, that theſe <hi>Walachrians</hi> play the lying <hi>Cretians,</hi> in making their <hi>Walachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Tribunall</hi> more rigid and preciſe then Chriſts own <hi>Tribunall.</hi>

               <p>For he declares, that they who are morally unclean, are made pure by faith alone and repentance, and therefore worthy of his ſacred Myſteries: They on the contrary, debarre from their Sacraments Antichriſtian-like, faithfull and penitent men as unclean, untill they have given ſatisfaction to their particular and uſurped right.</p>
               <p>But they goe about to waſh out this ſpot. <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it is not ſufficient that one declare himſelfe to be penitent, but this liberty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be kept under by the Rod of the leſſer Cenſure, &amp; that the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall received muſt be expiated as it were with an Eccleſiaſtick and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall penance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is moſt certain, that the licentious liberty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to bee curbed in Gods people, and ſcandals to bee removed. But I deny that it is in mans power to chooſe what meanes hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and that what he chooſeth muſt be held for divine. They are as much deceived, as if the old Levites had taken upon them to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate at their pleaſure, thoſe that were ceremonially polluted: For GOD hath ſet down the manner of expiating every ſinne: which being truly Divine, they could not tranſgreſſe. Now I would have the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Stilt-walker ſhew us by what Law hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Preachers to remove ſcandall from the Church ſo, as that a penitent ſinner ſhould be debarred from the Supper ſo long time as the Church-men ſhall prefixe; as if this power were given to them by a ſacred and Divine right. Hee ſhall as ſoone finde this in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the reſt of his lies (with which hee hath ſtuffed his patched peeces) to be divine truth. For the Scripture is ignorant of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern leſſer Cenſure; yea, it is repugnant to the inſtitution of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and their practice, as may bee ſeen by the Church or <hi>Corinth,</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> reproves their filthieſt ſinnes, with which hee ſaith, moſt of them were tainted.</p>
               <p>Surely in this caſe, if ever occaſion was offered to debarre them from the Communion, and that for a long time, that the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne might be for the time to come enrbed, and preſent ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals removed.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> But what did <hi>Paul</hi> in this caſe? He forbids them not, but plainly commands them to receive the Sacrament: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes no penitentiary puniſhments, nor the manner or times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but wills every man to examine himſelfe, and ſo to eate and drinke. So that hence it followes neceſſarily, that either <hi>Paul</hi> proſtituted thoſe holy Myſteries to the uncleane, or elſe that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114151:44"/>he was ignorant of this <hi>Walachrian</hi> ſanctity.</p>
               <p>But they will object, <hi>That Paul gave ſtrict charge, concerning the inceſtuous Corinthian, that as naughty leaven he ſhould be cast out of the Church.</hi>

               <p>I anſwer, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes there of delivering over to Satan, and not of the leſſer Cenſure, which is the fiction of Church-men, for eſtabliſhing of which this is alledged idlely. Secondly, the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Paul</hi> with the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> ſhewes that hee was ignorant of the figment of leſſer Excommunication. For not onely was that an abominable and capitall Crime which was committed by that member of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> by polluting himſelfe once and againe, but having no ſenſe or feeling of his ſinne, hee wallowed like a filthy Swine, in the uncleane mire of ſinne, in marrying and lying with his ſtep-mother, whom for his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie, and ſecurity in ſinne, <hi>Paul</hi> delivers over to Satan; but ſo, that hearing of his repentance, hee would not have the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced put in execution.</p>
               <p>But now if <hi>Paul</hi> had conſulted with the <hi>Walashrian</hi> Divines, a great queſtion had been moved, how the ſcandall given ſhould be removed? For it might ſeem fit that hee ſhould bee debarred from the Supper for ſome long time, or elſe ſome penitentiary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on him. But <hi>Paul</hi> being ignorant of all theſe new invented Artifices, as ſoone as hee heard of the ſinners repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, writes, <hi>It is ſufficient for him that hee hath been reproved of many. He wills them to comfort the ſinner, that he be not ſwallowed up with too much griefe.</hi> He addes, <hi>Whom you pardon, I will pardon in the ſight of Chriſt, that wee may not be deceived by Satan, becauſe his cunning plots are not unknown to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is true Divinity, but farre different from that of the Popes, and <hi>Walachrians,</hi> who for leſſer faults will not ſhew ſuch lenity to the penitent; but think that Chriſtians muſt be tortured under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of removing ſcandall; not that Chriſt might bee honored, or ſoules ſaved, but that hence domineering and profit might to them redound.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe this is no new evill cuſtome, but ancient, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begot after the Apoſtles death. For the Church-Rulers want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtolicall gifts of Miracles, and of infallible preaching, by which the Apoſtles, as Divine Maſter-builders, did curb all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſions, being then deſtitute of the Magiſtrates help, they found
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114151:45"/>out divers Conſtitutions and remedies for preſerving of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace, and removing of ſtandalls; which though they had not divine and Apoſtolicall authority; but were found out according to time and place; yet through cuſtome, by degrees, they became Lawes: ſo that not onely did they pertinaciouſly inſiſt upon them; but oftentimes uſed more rigour to preſerve them, then in Chriſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen inſtitutions, that they doubted not in defence of them to loſe their lives.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Lawes conſiſted chiefly in the right of cenſuring, and in Eccleſiaſtick penalties; among which this was ordinary, that if any had privatly or publikly offended, he was debarred from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, untill he had ſatisfied the Church concerning the ſcandall given; in which they were ſo rigid, that oftentimes they would keep men off from the Communion, three, foure, nay, ten yeares, and ſometimes all their life; eſpecially if any through impatience of their tortures had denied Chriſt; he was never again, or with much difficulty admitted into the Church. Which rigour Superſtition did ſo confirme, that afore the three hundreth yeare, <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> who becauſe of his torments had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Chriſt, came humbly to the Synod of an hundred and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Biſhops at <hi>Sinueſſa,</hi> and begged pardon for his ſin, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward taking courage, he ſuffered martyrdome for Chriſt, as <hi>Cornelius, Cyprian,</hi> and others did. So then, this right of cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was at that time ſo rigid, that in many things it exceeded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>And whileſt the Rulers were too carefull of their owne, and of the Churches honour, the common ſort of Chriſtians out of too much credulity, did ſuperſtitiouſly ſubject themſelves to Church-Lawes: Hence no moderation was obſerved, either by the one in commanding, or by the other in obeying; which <hi>Cyprian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaw long before the three hundreth yeare of Chriſt. For hee reproving that rigid and penitentiall way of cenſuring, writes thus: <hi>I wiſh all may be brought back to the Church: I pardon all, I winke at many things,</hi> I <hi>wiſh and deſire a Recollection of our fraterni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie,</hi> I <hi>have alwaſt offended my ſelfe in to much pardoning offences.</hi> So <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> later then he, writes plainly, <hi>If God be ſo mercifull, why ſhould his Prieſt ſeem to bee ſo rigid?</hi> For then they ſaw that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors exceed in their cenſures, and rigorous commands of peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary penalties: ſo that they confeſſed, they were againſt their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114151:45"/>wills, as it were, carried headlong by a Turren; into by wayes, which they could not allow, no knew not how to help, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the cuſtome then received in the Church. A though there might beſome uſe of ſuch Lawes then, when Paſtors and Biſhops did promiſcuouſly ſubmit themſelves and the rewards both of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ruled Chriſtians, then were tortures, beniſhments, and a thouſand deaths.</p>
               <p>After that Emperours became Chriſtians, and <hi>Petern</hi> patrimony increaſed, pride and prepoſtorous zeale ceiſed on the Teachers, ſo that they aſcribed as much to Church-inventions, as if they had been Gods Lawes; nor did they urge leſſe obedience to them, then if they had been inſtituted by Chriſt; which we may chiefly ſee in <hi>Ambroſe</hi> about the yeare 400. who of a civill P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For if this <hi>Spaniard Theodoſius</hi> had not been then ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that common ſuperſtition (which fell out well for the Church) that Church Lawes muſt bee obeyed as divine (which had he been wiſe he might have ſeene, that theſe were not ordained by God and his Apoſtles, but introduced by cuſtome, and humane invention,) he might have by his owne power, hipped <hi>Ambraſe</hi> his Hierarchy, by diſanulling theſe Church-inventions, and yet n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Hence then it is apparent, that however this leſſer Cenſure is brought into our Churches, and permitted by the States, yet it is not of divine inſtitution, but a meere humane invention, which heretofore was deviſed upon a ſpecious pretence; but by reaſon of the pride and arrogancy of Church-men, it hath hatched much miſchiefe, and will more doubtleſſe, if religious and wiſe Magiſtrates doe not prevent it.</p>
               <p>For all that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Stilt-walker hath ſaid, tends to this, that the leſſer Cenſure was inſtituted by Chriſt in his Church; and therefore is ſpirituall, holy, and of Divine right, and onely committed to Church-governours, but denied to Magiſtrates, who if they doe offer to touch it, they become ſacrilegious, and trample on the blood of Chriſt. If godly Magiſtrates ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves once to bee ſeaſoned with this perſwaſion, theſe new Papiſts will quickly prey upon their Majeſty, Fame, and Eſtates. Which worthy <hi>Vedelius</hi> ſmelling out, warnes Magiſtrates, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they would not ſuffer themſelves to be deluded. Hence the <hi>Stilt. walker</hi> growing fierce againſt him, upbraids him for his laviſh expreſſions, and falſly ſayes, that <hi>all good men are grieved,</hi> that ſuch Books ſhould be vented out of our Univerſity, which call in queſtion the ſanctity of Church-Diſcipline: yea, elſe-where playing both the Prophet and the Diſputer, uſeth direfull imprecations againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius,</hi> and I know not who elſe, who dare affirm, <hi>That the Church-Difcipline at this day is a Civill buſineſſe: under pretence of which, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters will prey upon the goods and fame of every man, if prevention be not uſed: and prepheſieth, that that Writer will one time, or other bee intangled with the terrors of his conſcience, when he lieth down ſecurely.</hi> Thus the Cuckooe ſings concerning the Conſcience, and a <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> puts worthy <hi>Vedelius</hi> in mind of piety: ſo the <hi>Sow</hi> will teach <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I wiſh him to beware, leſt hee bee puniſhed for ſo many wicked deeds, by the hands of ſome Noble <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> or ſome wiſe <hi>Solomon.</hi> Therefore let him look to it: this I'le ſay, that the leſſer Cenſure doth not onely contradict the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Apoſtles, and agree with Papiſticall tyranny, but alſo totally conſiſteth in this, That it is prejudiciall to the honour and profit of good Chriſtians, and chiefly to the Majeſty of Princes and Magiſtrates, as Church-men are maliciouſly affected. For ſince Chriſtians have learned to diſſemble, and under the Vizard of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to hunt after honour and profit, Magiſtrates have begun to ſerve the pride of Churchmen, that being honoured by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, they may attain the repute of Godly men. Time alſo, and an evill Genius, have taught ſpirituall Clergy-men to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, and to make bargaines of their Eccleſiaſtick Functions, which they will not performe without wages, and familiar acceſſe to the Perſons and Tables of great men; as when either the Preacher himſelfe; or ſome of his neere friends, doe gape at ſome prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church or State, the Magiſtrates help and ſuffrage is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>This hath been no where more practiced then in the <hi>Walachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Claſſis, that ſuch a Bargain being made, any man, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo infamous and wicked, may bee protected by the Churches Target, and ſo defended by their cenſuring Sword, that though hee be guilty of ſedition, fraud, drunkenneſſe, and moſt grievous ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, hee ſhall not bee debarred from the Communion, or from keeping company with the Clergy: but for his moſt notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill deeds, ſhall to the griefe and reluctancie of good men, attaine to places of Honour in the Church, and of profit in the State.</p>
               <p>Nor is this ſpirituall Sword defenſive onely, but offenſive alſo. For if ſome grave man ſit at the Helme of Government in the State, whoſe life and faith are unblameable, onely defective in not ſupporting <hi>Apolonian</hi> Church pride; hee muſt expect ſome miſchiefe intended againſt him, by under-hand dealing, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of Suffrages. And I heare that cheating perfidiouſneſſe and perjuries, cannot be practiſed ſo impudently, but if occaſion ſerve, the holineſſe of the <hi>Wallachrian</hi> Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline will ſanctifie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114151:47"/>them all in the <hi>Apolonian</hi> Clergie. If in the Civill Court the thing ſucceed not, then they flye for help to the cenſure and leſſer excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, by deviſing ſomething, which may bring him in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace among the people: For this impaires not their ſanctity, that they know they obtrude upon the people falſhoods, and fictions, if they can but obtain credit: neither matters it whether or not one be accuſed in that Court of true or falſe crimes.</p>
               <p>It is an old practice there, Firſt to puniſh, then to enquire into the cauſe, or to deviſe a cauſe of puniſhment: as the Scribes ſayd of Chriſt, <hi>If hee were not guilty, wee had not delivered him to you: we have a Law, by which he muſt dye.</hi> So that no man can live there ſo warily, but that <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis will trouble him by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Sword of their leſſer Cenſure: For they thinke that they can by their leſſer Cenſure, make a Publican of a Chriſtian; that is, a great ſinner, and hatefull to all the people. Which therefore they call, The Publicans excommunication: So it is moſt evident, that there is no other uſe of the leſſer Cenſure there, but that theſe unhappily new up-ſtart Papiſts, may ſatisfie their owne perverſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and by indirect wayes remove them from the Helme of Government in the State, againſt whom they have any ſpleen, by leſſening their eſteeme among the people, and wronging them by their ſlanders; perſwading ignorant people, that they never make uſe of this Cenſure, but upon juſt and weighty cauſes. <hi>Apolonius</hi> cannot bee ſo ignorant, but muſt know, that by his help this Play hath been acted an hundred times. Whence the godly and prudent Magiſtrate may conclude, that the cauſes of inſpection, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mens actions by the leſſer Cenſure, are no leſſe then by the greater: for this they commit not to Church-men alone, for ſome politick reſpects, leſt they ſhould raſhly inſult over the fame of their ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this is no leſſe aimed at in the leſſer Cenſure, the whole intent of which is, that they may intrap indirectly, not onely Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but Princes themſelves, and may mock them after the old Papiſts example; they muſt provide that the Common wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no prejudice, and that men bee not affrighted by faigned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſanctity; whereas this leſſer Cenſure is a meere humane invention, equall to the figments of old Popery, as it is maintained by the <hi>Walachrian Stilt-walker.</hi> For not onely hath it there rumated
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114151:47"/>the Church, and Religion; but alſo hath brought the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate into ſubjection; from which thraldome the High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty States will not be long free, if the reſt of the Miniſters follow the example of theſe <hi>Walacrian</hi> Papiſts, in daring to inſult by words and deeds over them.</p>
               <p>But this leſſer Cenſure wil not ſuffice <hi>Apolonius,</hi> who is as wiſe as mad <hi>Ajax,</hi> that killed his ſheep to pleaſe his minde; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a high eſteeme of the greater cenſure, by which he thinks he hath power given him by God, to make Heathens of Chriſtians: Which way of cenſuring is the very old Popiſh way; nor is it more like Chriſts inſtitution, and the Apoſtles practice, then Gold is like Droſſe. For the old Cenſure, firſt inſtituted by GOD, and uſed by the Jewes, was practiſed by Apoſtolicall Churches; and that by the command of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>This conſiſted firſt in verball reprehenſion, which all were bound to exerciſe, and that by divine right, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Separation, when they withdrew themſelves from their company, and avoyded the converſation of ſuch as were not bettered by admonition and reprehenſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.10, 11. Which ſeparation was made for two cauſes: Firſt, that by this the contagion of ſinne might bee avoyded. Secondly, that the ſinner ſeeing himſelfe deſpiſed, might be aſhamed, and ſo might hence take an occaſion to repent.</p>
               <p>The Jewes in Chriſts time by vertue of this Cenſure alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred Publicans and ſinners from their companies in privat, whom they could not keep out of the Temple; who therefore reproved Chriſt, becauſe he did eat and drink, and keep company with Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners, whoſe inſtitution Chriſt did not abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, but corrected, ſhewing that it was not ſimply unlawfull to converſe with Publicans and ſinners, but lawfull, when any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the gifts of inſtructing, admoniſhing, and reproving, like a Phyſitian cures them of their evils and ſpirituall maladies.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6.14. where hee teacheth, that we muſt not converſe with them who live diſorderly, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this ſeparation contemned, they might be aſhamed: but that they ſhould bee excommunicated out of the Church, or debarred from Divine worſhip, and meanes of ſalvation, wee read not in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114151:48"/>Scripture: but rather to admoniſh them, to reprove them, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but not reject them as enemies. And as he teacheth in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 25. we muſt uſe them with lenity, although they make reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>This is the ancient Cenſure grounded on Divine Precepts, and the practice of Antiquity, of moſt Divine right, and moſt fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſinne and ſcandall out of the Church: which had it continued, all Eccleſiaſtick tyranny had been removed out of the Church; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſo much careleſneſſe, and contagion of ſcandals fallen among Chriſtians, eſpecially their Rulers. For each Chriſtian being ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous of his own and neighbours ſalvation, by admoniſhing, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and ſeparating them, when need required, hee had removed from his brethren ſinnes and ſcandall, yea even from the Doctors themſelves, by right of this fraternity: as we ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter,</hi> when he walked not uprightly; and how <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> did inſtruct and admoniſh that famous Teacher <hi>Apollos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now here we ſee the Churches infelicity, for the Pride of the Doctors, eſpecially among Papiſts, hath taken away this old Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; becauſe it gave too much power to all and ſingular Chriſtians, whom they began to account for Lay-men, and thought it unworthy that the care of great buſineſſe ſhould be committed to every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church: But Clergie-men took all this upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and made that Office peculiar to themſelves, which God had granted to all and ſingular: Whence ariſe theſe miſchiefes which we ſee this day in the Church: Firſt, in that the common ſort of Chriſtians laying aſide all care of the Church, and holy myſteries, give themſelves totally over to worldly buſineſſe, leaving the Office of cenſuring to Miniſters altogether. Secondly, in that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are ſo puffed up with this prerogative, that they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the onely Judges of cenſures and Manners, and that they are armed with ſuch power, as if they could by divine priviledge open and ſhut heaven, bind and looſe, and make of a Chriſtian a prophane man and a Publican: which perſwaſion, as ſoon as it poſſeſſed mens minds, it firſt brought Eccleſiaſtick tyranny into the Church, and at length begot Antichriſtian Popes, who by this power of cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath ſubjected to himſelfe all Chriſtians, eſpecially the Kings of the earth. As we may ſee in that wicked <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> of whom we ſpoke before: who about the yeare 1080. forced <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour, a man of a degenerate ſpirit, and who had committed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114151:48"/>adultery with the Whore of Babel,
<note place="margin">Platina.</note> to make a journey bare-footed through Ice and Snow to him, being then at <hi>Canaſſa;</hi> where for three dayes togother he did humbly intreat to bee admitted, which he could not obtaine without the interceſſion of diſhoneſt <hi>Mythil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and her Ruffians; by whoſe mediation he was admitted at laſt to fall down at that wicked Popes feet, and to receive pardon.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe at this day the Popes pride is not ſo great, becauſe out of the <hi>Revelation</hi> wee are taught, that many Kings now forſake the Whore, and ſpoyle her. But whatſoever he doth at this day, in his intollerable pride, he doth it under the ſole Title of the Sword, and of the power of Cenſuring, whoſe thunder-bolt is Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And though this mocker of all holy things, knowes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, that this his thunder is not more valid then a Fart, yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the timerous ſuperſtitious people, and they beleeve him, that it is a thing of great ſpirituality and force: So that one who was too ſuperſtitious, ſeeing with what pomp excommunication was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at <hi>Rome,</hi> cried out, that doubtleſſe hee was thruſt out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whom the Pope thus excommunicated.</p>
               <p>For he is a pleaſant Actor in this Play, which is performed with ſtrange running up and downe of Church-Ruffians and the Popes Paraſites, with great jangling of Bells, with a wonderfull kindling of fires and Torches, and a ſudden putting of them out: and although in this he doth nothing, but what with as great dexterity is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med daily by Stage-players in their Tragedies; yet by a fatall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of error, he hath ſo prevailed with Princes, that they beleeve him to be a moſt holy Father, whom they ſee, and often confeſſe, to be a moſt wicked knave, and that his excommunication is a matter of wonderfull force and ſanctity; albeit they know that hee debarres them, not from heaven, but from their earthly goods, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him by force of armes.</p>
               <p>The chiefe places out of which heretofore the Antichriſtian Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants did beat out the Popes Eccleſiaſtick thunder of the greater Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; are theſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17, 18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.5. and that is of chiefe account, which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>giving him the Key<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>power to forgive and retaine ſinnes, and to bind that in Heaven which is bound on earth:</hi> this is commonly thought to bee given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſpeciall priviledge; with which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114151:49"/>Title the Pope is ſo proud, that he carries the Keyes in his Armes, as if he were that Door-keeper, or Claviger of hell, mentioned in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſo aſcribes to himſelfe alone, as being <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, this power of the Keyes: By the perſwaſion of this ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hath ſubjected the whole world to him: For ſo he threatens, that hee will ſhut Heaven gates againſt all thoſe who will not obey him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Walachriah Stilt-Walker</hi> being inſtructed in the Popes ſchool, he trumpets out every where, the power of the Apoſtolicall Keyes, with ſo great pride of Juriſdiction, and of commanding power, that the Popes Keyes, and thoſe of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> ſeem to bee made by the ſame <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which want nothing but a little better poliſhing, which in time will be done: For who ever will turne over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts writings, and theſe of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> ſhall ſee, that whatſoever the Pope proudly bragges of concerning his Hierarchy, in the right of <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſion, the ſame doth <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and the new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts proudly challenge in right of Apoſtolicall ſucceſſion. Nor do I deny, but this hath been too common among divers reformed teachers, to be ſomewhat ſuperſtitiouſly affected with this right of the Keyes, and of Excommunication; which is not to be wondred at, ſeeing ſome of the Reformers had been bred in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> whoſe Botchers ſhop was filled with ſuch old traſh of Juriſdiction, it could ſcarce be otherwiſe, but that the moſt part being born there, muſt ſmell of that mother: But afterwards ſome others treading in their foot-ſteps, and prouder then the former, did too much advance this Eccleſiaſtick power of the Keyes: So that we muſt confeſſe, it hath fallen out with many Reformers, as it doth with thoſe who goe about to purge out the Garlick which they have eate; who though they doe what they can to purge and remove it, yet they ceaſe not to ſmell more or leſſe of it.</p>
               <p>This may bee ſeen in many, chiefly in our <hi>Walachrian Stilt-wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> who above all others delighting in the menſtruous blood of his Romiſh mother, and ſmelling ſo rank of it, boaſts ſo proudly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where of the power of the Keyes, that you ſhall ſcarce find his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; whoſe fooleries that I may now refell, this I ſay, That there is nothing more certaine, then that Chriſt in promiſing the Keyes to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Apoſtles, did conferre on them no vulgar thing, but what was both new, rare, and excellent, and by which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114151:49"/>he would exalt them above humane reach, as it were, when he gave them this power of heavens Keyes. Whence it is not likely, that by theſe is meant ſo ſmall and eaſie a matter, as the Church at this day exerciſeth. For what great or rare matter is this, if a Church-Ruler, or Preacher ſay at this day, the Kingdome of Heaven is open to thee, if thou beleeve; if thou beleeveſt not, it is ſhut againſt thee? Not onely was this the ancient preaching, but almoſt every ordinary man in the Church can ſay ſo; Yea whoever reads the Scripture, or heares but a childe reading them, hee exerciſeth this judgement of himſelfe, and uſeth the Key: For if he ſee any diſobedient, hee will judge that heaven is ſhut againſt him, if hee repent not: If again hee ſee him convert, he will judge that heaven is opened, and ſo will uſe this Key.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt Church-men think, that they have now more power in uſing this Key: For we finde by experience, that Clergy. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, Conſiſtories, Claſſes, or Synods, are no more powerfull in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing this judgement, then any private man, being intent on the thing, and carefull to ſearch out the truth; ſo that wee find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that one Lay-man hath judged better, and hath made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of this Key, then a whole Synod. For though <hi>Apolonius</hi> prate much concerning the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt; yet we finde no other effects thereof, then what the Pope boldly bragges concerning his infallibillity, and yet hee is the lyingeſt faiſiſter that ever the world ſaw: So then, theſe Church-men are very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes deceived, who bragge ſo much of the power and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Keyes.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Apolonius</hi> witneſſe, then which no man is a more impudent bragger of this power of the Keyes, except the Pope: and yet by his preaching Key he hath produced ſo many lies, that he may ſeem to carry not the Key of Heaven, but of Hell, with <hi>Apollion.</hi> And that you may not think this to be a perſonall errour, (except he will alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in this) lo the whole <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ented to theſe fictions; ſo that hence appears the falſe judgement of the Church, in the uſe of the preaching Key; becauſe not onely it is not of greater force then a private Chriſtian mans iudgement, but oftentimes of leſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity: For at this day the iudgement of Church-men, is ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with affections, that we may beleeve many whom they condemn to hell, ſhall ſurely enioy heaven: and on the contrary, they ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114151:50"/>goe to hell, whom they iudge worthy of heaven by their Key. How ever the matter be, it cannot be evidently proved, that now Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have any greater power in uſing the Keyes of Heaven, then any particular member of the Church, whilſt in their Sermons, their threatnings and promiſes of life eternall, are conditionall. Whence it is not likely that Chriſt gave ſo little right as this to the Apoſtles, under the glorious title of the Keyes of heaven, and of ſo ſolemne a promiſe, but that there was in this ſome high matter, and peculiar to the Apoſtles onely, which I place in this, becauſe they were the firſt Heralds of ſalvation performed now by Chriſt, and of heaven opened by him, which was never proper before nor after to any of Gods Embaſſadours.</p>
               <p>Before the work of ſalvation was performed, ſalvation was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for; but then heaven was in a manner ſhut as yet. After Chriſts Aſcenſion it was truly opened. And this priviledge the Apoſtles had, that they were the firſt witneſſes hereof. Beſides, before that time heaven was ſhut againſt the Gentiles, who as it were by a partition wall, were debarred from entring thither; ſo that no man, nay not the greateſt Prophets before this, had power to open heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly to all Gentiles, the Jewes being forſaken. This matter was ſo high and rare, that even the Apoſtles, though illuminate by Gods Spirit, came to know this when it was late, and not without Miracles too; which being underſtood, they without weariſomneſſe by a divine &amp; wonderful rapture contemning all dangers, carried the Goſpel almoſt through all the world; ſo that <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelfe, as grave Authours witneſſe, preached and travelled as farre as <hi>India.</hi> Which indeed was notable, and nothing elſe but the opening of heaven.</p>
               <p>To this was added their infallible power of preaching, that they ſayd nothing but by Gods preſcription. For the preaching Key which Chriſt promiſed and gave to his Diſciples, was ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine, that with it he gave unto thoſe firſt Patriarchs of the Church, graces by which they delivered the truth infallibly: ſo that not onely did they ſhew Heaven opened, but by their infallible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as with a Key, did open it to every one, and declared it infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly by their divine power of judging, to whom it was opened or ſhut; ſo that what they bound and ſhut on earth, was truly bound and ſhut in heaven: And contrarily.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114151:50"/>
               <p>This power after the Apoſtles ceaſed. For what they once opened, remaines open, nor can it be ſhut again by any.</p>
               <p>The Pope bragges, that this right remaines onely for him, as being <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and ſo commonly his ſubjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. But this is an impudent lye fit for Antichriſt. Our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellonians</hi> doe indeed convince the Pope of ſacriledge for his bragging thus; and yet they themſelves are more impudently puffed up with this power of the Keyes. For they confeſſe, and in effect prove, that they cannot preach infallibly; and yet they cry out, that he is guilty of ſacriledge, who doubts of their poſſeſſing their Key now. Which impudency is farre greater then that of the Pope. For he aſſumes to himſelfe the right of opening heaven, becauſe he ſaith that he hath an infallible Key, and truly Apoſtolicall.</p>
               <p>But theſe will have the ſame right aſcribed to them, and yet doe confeſſe that they are not infallible: Although hee bee an Impoſtor, who promiſeth to open the Treaſure, making ſhew of having that Key which hee hath not: yet hee is a more impudent Impoſtor who cries out that hee will open the Treaſure, and yet confeſſeth, that either he hath no Key, or if he ſhewes any Key, it is ſo unfit and ruſty, that it cannot open the Lock. For becauſe the moderne preaching Key wants true ſpirituality, which is the infallibility of truth, it is to be accounted a dead body, or like a Clock which is moved about with wheels: But theſe are ſet on work by the weight of honour and gain.</p>
               <p>No otherwiſe can wee think of the Judiciall or Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Key; which in the Apoſtles, by reaſon of their gifts and power, was alwayes juſt and effectuall: For they had a moſt divine certitude of Judicature; ſo that they conferred Heaven upon none, nor debarred any from it, but by a ſure knowledge and revelation; ſo that aſſuredly Heaven was ſhut againſt them whom they bound, and whoſe ſins were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on earth; and it was certainly opened to them whom they looſed, and pardoned. It is ſufficiently evident, that theſe gifts and power were in the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>All which, as moſt rare, and exceeding humane reach, were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114151:51"/>promiſed to the Apoſtles under the power of the Keyes, which is apparent to all who will not ſhut their eyes wilfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of truth.</p>
               <p>Whence it is cleare, that the Keyes are terminated in the Apoſtles, becauſe thoſe conditions, with the gifts which I ſpoke, and which make up the Juriſdiction of the Keyes, are ceaſed with them: So with as great right they make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Office permanent, and perpetuall in the Church, as the uſe of theſe heavenly Keyes: So that it is frivolous and ridiculous for <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and the Pope, to bragge ſo much of the power of the Keyes, as though hee had power to ſhut and open heaven, to binde and looſe on Earth, what is bound and looſed in Heaven: Whereas hee knowes not whom he ſhall certainly ſhut out of heaven, or ſhut in: And oftentimes perverſly hee looſeth and judgeth worthy of heaven, whom God bindeth and ſhutteth out of heaven. And contrarily, he excludes from heaven, whom God thinkes worthy of Heaven: ſo that he who compares the vizard of our moderne Cenſure and Excommunicacion, to that of the Apoſtles, ſeemes no otherwiſe to play the foole, then the Jewes did, who were wont to prate ſtrange things of the ſanctity of their Temple, and fought for the honour thereof againſt <hi>Titus,</hi> till they were deſtroyed. And yet they might have known, had they not been blind, that that was not the old Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe it wanted Urim and Thummim, and all the benefites of Divine preſence and aſſiſtance, which made up the particular ſanctity of that Temple.</p>
               <p>But there ſeemes to bee a plainer place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell the Church, and if hee heares not the Church, let him bee to thee as a Publican and Heathen.</hi> In which words, they ſay, Chriſt hath given to the Church, Judiciall Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick power of excommunication, which at this day is in uſe both amongſt the old and new Papiſts.</p>
               <p>The vanity of this conceit will bee eaſily ſeen, if wee doe but obſerve that Chriſt in theſe words doth not inſtruct his Diſciples, as they were to be the over-ſeers and Rulers of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114151:51"/>Church, but onely taught ordinary things, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Chriſtians by the right of fraternity, according to that generall Rule given to all by GOD, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 17.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother, but ſharply reprove him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou ſuffer any evill in him.</hi> Which Law CHRIST here ſheweth, muſt be kept, not onely when a brother ſhall offend God or others, but then alſo when he wrongs us; which brotherly duty Chriſt will have wiſely to bee exerciſed, and with moderation, leſt this reproofe may ſeem to proceed from revenge or evill words, by which the mind of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring brother, may bee exaſperated, hee will have the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offence to be covered, and not to be divulged; but will have the difference to be taken up in private between bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brother, by two other brothers: whoſe admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the offending brother ſlight, Chriſt permits not that the brother offended ſhall forſake the brother offending, but then will have the brothers offence brought out in publicke, that it may be made known to all the Church, not to ſtirre up all odiouſly againſt him; but that they might ſave him: and that he who could not be brought to concord by the reproofe of one or more brothers, may be brought to it by the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of ſome in the Church, or all.</p>
               <p>Which endeavour of the Church being brotherly and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, if the offending brother goe on to contemne, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended brother is not onely permitted, but alſo commanded to eſteem of the other, at a Publican and Heathen; that is, that he ſhall have no private commerce with him; as the Apoſtle deſcribes and declares this act, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.11. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6.14. For Chriſt alludes to the cuſtome that then was among the Jewes, and of which we have already ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Hence now it appeares, that the old and new Papiſts have ſhamefully corrupted this place, in turning this brotherly and charitable duty, into an authoritative and judiciall Office, and very inſolently have appropriated the word CHURCH, to the Rulers and Over-ſeers of the Church onely. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> that is (ſaith the Papiſt) tell the Biſhop, which is truly a fooliſh interpretation, unworthy of refutation. <hi>Tell
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114151:52"/>the Church,</hi> that is, (ſay our new Papiſts) tell the Rulers of the Church; which is an unaccuſtomed acception of this word: For they cannot produce one place out of Scripture, in which the word CHURCH is appropriated to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers onely. I know the <hi>Walachrian Stilt-Walker</hi> babbles much every where of the Church repreſentative, and that the word <hi>Church</hi> is given to the Rulers thereof, becauſe they repreſent the Church.</p>
               <p>But becauſe hee learned this, not out of Scripture, but out of Popiſh writings, the inventors of this; I anſwer him brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That to him who ſayes much, and proves nothing, of right no priviledge belongs; which as it is true in humane things, ſo much more in Divine and ſacred matters.</p>
               <p>Whence I now conclude; whereas both the Antecedents and Conſequents, and the whole context of Chriſts words doe ſhew, that in this place hee did not inſtitute a judiciall, but a brotherly and charitable duty in the Church; and that by the name of <hi>Church</hi> here, hee underſtands all and each member of the Church. It is ridiculous that the <hi>Walachrian Stilt-Walker,</hi> with the Papiſts, ſhould be underſtood here, who out of nothing, or the ragges of old Popery, (which at length begot Antichriſt) hath gone about to erect ſo glorious and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a judiciall Eccleſiaſtick power, to which Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all worldly Potentates, by divine and ſpeciall right, ought to ſubmit themſelves.</p>
               <p>He brings elſwhere other Reaſons for his thunder of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; but I will not trouble my ſelf to refell them, leſt I ſhould miſpend good houres, whereas the underſtanding Reader may eaſily perceive of himſelf, that now the power of the Keyes being taken away, with that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> all his Reaſons will of themſelves fall to the ground. There remaines only one main argument, one which he ſpends almoſt 15. pages of his patched peece, his Argument is this, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 6. <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>writing to the whole Church of Corinth, wills and commands, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all aſſembled, ſhould deliver over to Satan the inceſtuous man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Therefore the right and power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114151:52"/>contumacims ſinners, belongs to all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> For as in his Aſſumption he is very liberall; ſo hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that to deliver over to Satan is nothing elſe then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his manner to excommunicate.</p>
               <p>Where firſt obſerve his fraud, in making this Argument: For thus he propounds it, as if the Apoſtle had granted to that particular Church, power to give over to Satan that Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> ſimply. Which being granted, hee foreſaw that this Argument would carry ſome ſhew of truth. But this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Impoſtor deludes his Reader as he uſeth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle doth not ſimply grant this power to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> for he wills, though abſent in body, yet by the preſence and aſſiance of his power and Spirit, the Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous man to be delivered to Satan, whom already he alone had adiudged to Satan, as he himſelfe witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being cleared thus, I will aske of the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> What Logick hath taught him ſo to reaſon? <hi>Paul</hi> gave power to one Church to excommunicate, with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Spirit, and of his power: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Every Church can doe this by it ſelfe, and without <hi>Pauls</hi> aſſiſtance, or of his Spirit. Here is no ſequence, and it is all one as if he would ſay, the particular Church of Jeruſalem, with the aſſiſtance of the Apoſtles, preſcribed to all other Churches, a Law to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from blood and things ſtrangled: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Conſiſtory of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> at this day hath the ſame power over the other Churches. Which conſequence I know the Claſſes of <hi>Zealand</hi> will not admit; yet they would eaſily grant this, if in their Conſiſtory in ſtead of <hi>Apolonius</hi> one <hi>Paul</hi> were preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or any other Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Apoſtle for this reaſon reproved the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that they had not removed the inceſtuous perſon: And therefore it is plain, that it was in their power to have removed that wicked man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, this cannot be evinced out of that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe the words import no ſuch matter. <hi>He reproves them that they were puft up, and did not rather mourn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that he that had done this deed, might be taken away.</hi> Which forme of ſpeech is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114151:53"/>all one, as if he that hath been long and dangerouſly ſick, ſhould be reproved by the Phyſitian, for being ſo ſecure and careleſſe in removing his diſeaſe: For there were many things which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might have done of themſelves in removing of this great evill. They might have ſignified this offence to <hi>Paul</hi> by letters, and ſought his advice, and the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, that that wicked man might be taken away: But the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> neglected all this; in which reſpect they were not without cauſe ſayd to be puffed up, not to have mourned, that he might be taken away who committed this wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Apolonius) Paul warnes the Corinthians that they purge out the old leven. And in the end of the chapter commands, that they would caſt out the inceſtuous perſon, and judge of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Ergo, this was an ordinary act, and in their power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the Antecedent is not ſimply true: for what the Apoſtle ſpeakes of leven, is not of removing the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon: but in theſe words he doth in generall onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to a good life, as the Text ſheweth. Secondly, Let us grant this, that the Apoſtles words are meant of removing the inceſtuous perſon, by what Logick again will hee evince, that the buſines which the Apoſtle enjoyns to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was ſimply committed to be done by them as an ordinary act altogether in their power? The Context ſhewes no ſo ſuch thing, but quite contrary: He grants them power to judge, but not without his own judgement: hee will have them caſt out this party, but not without the aſſiſtance of his power and ſpirit; becauſe therefore the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could do many things concerning the outward circumſtances of this act, which <hi>Paul</hi> being abſent could not doe; therefore he himſelfe enjoyned this action to them.</p>
               <p>For they might have reproved him verbally, and uſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Imprecations againſt him; they might have ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from him; all which things, and perhaps more, in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of this act, did meet together; but for the internall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of this act, they of themſelves could not produce or touch; for it depended from the power of the Keyes, by which Chriſt promiſed that ſhould be ratified in heaven, whatſoever the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114151:53"/>ſhould here on earth determine concerning ſinners; the truth and effect of which promiſe, becauſe men had then found divers times by experience, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence it was that this cenſuring power of the Apoſtles, whether they exerciſed it alone, or with the Church, was alwayes, and not without cauſe, horrid and terrible, not only to them who were to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted, but alſo to the refractory, whoſe blaſphemies he might have eaſily curbed, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. Surely if the delivering over to Satan, had been nothing elſe then a verball thunder out of the pulpit, as at this day refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men being thus excommunicate, would have learned to blaſ pheme more, as may be ſeen in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and others after the Apoſtles departure, and in divers at this day.</p>

                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Stilt-walker) it is not likely that Paul being abſent could deliver over the inceſtuous man to Satan.</hi> This is ſurely ridiculous in ſo great a Doctor! who out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Naaman,</hi> 3 <hi>King.</hi> 5. might have learned, that the men of God, furniſhed with the gift or Miracles, did exerciſe their gifts, not only neere at hand, but alſo a farre off: for <hi>Eliſha</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Naaman</hi> being farre off from him: why then could not <hi>Paul</hi> do the ſame, eſpecially being preſent in ſpirit with them, though abſent in the body? <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged as being preſent, &amp;c.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>You being gathered together and my ſpirit, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> There was then, beſides the ordinary and brotherly Office of cenſuring, a more grievous correction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles; peculiar only to thoſe divinely-inſpired men, by reaſon of their ſpeciall gifts, with which being then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, could when need was, ſtrike with blindneſſe, or death, or deliver over to Satan ſtubborn and blaſphemous ſinners.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Apolenius</hi> think himſelfe by vertue of his vocation, a Succeſſor to this power, we will expect that hee alſo will give ſight to the blind, feet to the lame, raiſe the dead, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Divels, and deliver mens bodies to bee tortured by them. We may ſee by his Writings, that if he could enjoy his own Genius, ſometimes he would revenge himſelfe upon the civill Magiſtrate, with this great Excommunication, except they abſtain from his Spiritualities. But let him know, that I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114151:54"/>doe not much feare, if they be delivered over to Satan by him; but let him rather feare, leſt if with <hi>Sceva's</hi> ſonnes hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this exorciſme raſhly, he heare the evill ſpirit ſay, <hi>Ieſus I know, and Paul I know, but Apolonius, who be you?</hi> So that he be forced to ſtye away with them, having not onely loſt his <hi>Stilts,</hi> &amp; narrow <hi>Chapines,</hi> but alſo ſtript of all his Cloathes.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly ſet down what was the ordinary right of cenſuring in the Church, appoynted by Chriſt; and I have ſhewed, that it was not Judicial, or of ſpeciall right, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and brotherly, conſiſting in a verball and brotherly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, and in ſeparation from privat Commerce. I have ſhewn alſo, that beſides this common way of cenſuring, there was under the Apoſtles a more heavy correction, which they uſed not againſt any kind of ſinner, but onely againſt ſuch as were infamous for ſtubborneſſe, or ſome heynous offence in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and polluting the Church of Chriſt; which then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and truly divine, as depending on the power of the Keyes, and divine gifts; of which there was ſuch efficacie in thoſe being inſpired by God, that whatſoever they intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, was not onely ratified in heaven, but on earth alſo, had its effect. This Apoſtolicall and terrible kind of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, how ever it was neceſſary and uſefull for the Church in its infancy, whoſe beginnings Chriſt would not have to be maintained by the Sword; yet he ſuffered this to dye with the Apoſtles, untill at laſt it brought Kings themſelves to yeeld ſubjection, and of bloody perſecuters made them the Churches Patrons, preſervers, and nurſing Fathers, according as <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſay</hi> had propheſied before; which being fulfilled, a more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid way of cenſuring was again revived in the Church, by the ordinary power of Princes and Magiſtrates with which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, not onely for preſervation of naturall ſociety among men, but chiefly to maintain the Church of Chriſt intire here on earth. For though Princes lawes and puniſhments of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they pertain not to the conſcience; yet accidentally they build up and defend Chriſts Kingdome, whilſt they ſet up that outward and rigid diſcipline, and help the Church againſt wicked and refractory men, who could not by brotherly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, be taken off from the pollution of ſinne and ſcandall.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:114151:54"/>
               <p>So that now every man may ſee, that the greater and leſſer cenſures are nothing elſe but the filthy ſecundine of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mother of the Romiſh Church, and ſpots cleaving to our Churches from that Nativity; which notwithſtanding this walachrian Impoſtor, vents abroad for moſt holy, and extells as moſt ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>But to him that will look narrowly, it is cleere, that all this judiciall and cenſuring buſineſſe which is urged by the <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrians,</hi> and defended under a divine and moſt holy title, is not inſtituted by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, but by Man; which being by the ancient Papiſts ſet out in divers dreſſings, at laſt brought forth the Pope that great Antichriſt, and in ſhort time among the Reformed, will beget many Antichriſts; the contemners of civill Magiſtrates and Princes, except they prevent this in time.</p>
               <p>Heretofore, divers of the firſt Reformers being holy, and provident men, did fore-ſee this; who therefore did their beſt to extinguiſh this Antichriſtian Leaven, as their Writings wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for their ſakes, who perhaps are ignorant of this, I will here ſub joyne what they have written concerning this matter, which may ſeeme to make very much for our purpoſe. The words of <hi>Gualter</hi> in a certaine Epiſtle of his to <hi>Carolus Ionvilleus</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> are theſe,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But if we muſt ſpeak of excommunication, that was never totally and generally condemned by us; for it is commanded by our Lawes, whereby they are excluded from our private ſocietie, and from the enjoying of our publike Paſtours; who deſpiſing publike and private admonitions, doe not live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of Chriſtianity, but that any ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from our holy Aſſemblies, or the Lords Supper, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſed in our Church, nor in many others: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, no man hitherto could juſtly accuſe, eyther for want of purity in Faith and Doctrine, or for licentiouſneſſe of converſation: For no man hitherto hath demonſtrated by fit and firme arguments, that that ſhould be the Symboll of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or Superſtition, which was ordained to be the meanes of conſervation of the Churches unity; for which cauſe, the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114151:55"/>Antients called it a convention or meeting. Therefore, I wonder, my moſt deare <hi>Ionvill,</hi> why you ſhould ſay, that I bring in a new and unheard of Paradoxe; beſides, all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in theſe calamitous times of the Church. For, why ſhould that be called new, or unheard of, which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in our Church, now from the beginning full 50. yeares.</p>
                  <p>Surely <hi>Suinglius</hi> of bleſſed memory, the firſt Reformer of Religion among the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> hath written the ſame things expreſly in his friendly Expoſition to <hi>Luther</hi> which we at this day teach and think. And though the ſame was moſt ſtrictly joyned in friendſhip and love with <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> yet hee would never bring into the Church of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> ſuſpending from the Supper] and afterward.</p>
                  <p>[But what <hi>Bullinger</hi> my Maſter and reverend Father did think of this matter, his Booke againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly witneſſe; and chiefly, what he writes in <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 6. &amp;c. What ſhall we neede to ſpeak of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> who whileſt the Churches of high <hi>Germany</hi> did flouriſh more then they do now taught in <hi>Auſburge,</hi> and afterward in <hi>Berne,</hi> with great applauſe. He every where admoniſheth Miniſters to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rather to gather, then to exclude any. And hee ſo handles this matter upon the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that it is cleere he is of our opinion.</p>
                  <p>I could adde to theſe, the example of the Church of <hi>Conſtance</hi> &amp;c.] and a little after [in our age, many learned and godly men have conferred about this matter often times, and they have alwayes agreed in this, that Diſcipline is neceſſary in the Church (which we confeſſe, yea we urge and ſhall urge, ſo king as God will ſpare our life:) But for the manner and forme thereof, it is to be left free for every Church, that ſhe may uſe the forme which will build up, and not which may ſhake and overthrow,] thus he who in another Epiſtle, to count <hi>Lodovic Witgenſteinius</hi> thus writes: [Whereas you reckon Church Diſcipline among the outward meanes of ſalvation, although I doe not altogether reject it, yet I beſeech your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie not to take it ill if I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by many at this day is controverted: and if the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114151:55"/>rigidneſſe of ſome men, be not tempered by the prudet authority of Princes, they will raiſe greater troubles, then will be eaſily appeaſed, and will bring into the Church a new tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as intollerable as that of the Popes. We all confeſſe, that Churches cannot ſubſiſt without Diſcipline, and that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary, that it bee religiouſly ordained and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>But for the forme of this, all men doe not agree; your men place the maine point of Diſcipline, in excluding from the Communion: beſides, they propoſe a certain time for thoſe who are excluded, how long they muſt abſtaine; and that they may maintain the Diſcipline, they ſay there is need of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Senate, to which men of all rankes and orders, yea Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves muſt be ſubject.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things are of ſuch a nature, that godly and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected men doubt much of the truth of them: for it is demanded not without cruſe, if the Lords Supper inſtituted by Chriſt for a Symboll of Chriſtian Society and Communion and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Faith, ſhould be converted to any uſe, not onely different but quite contrary to Chriſts inſtitution; ſo that it becomes the inſtrument of excluſion and diſ union, and the torturer of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?</p>
                  <p>Againe, whether this doth not fight againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, who commands every one to prove himſelfe, and not to make curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcrutinies over other mens Conſciences. Beſides, whether it be not a hard &amp; an unjuſt caſe that a ſinner who ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and whom Chriſt feedes with his owne body and bloud, as being doubtleſſe received into favour, ſhould be driven from the Table, yea prohibited, that hee ſhall not declare the Lords death publikely with the Church, whereof he is a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>Moreover is it not like a Monſter to ſet up two Magiſtrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips among the ſame people] and a little after.</p>
                  <p>[Hence then ariſe the hornes of new tyramie, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ambitious Miniſters will liſt up the creſt, who may eaſily draw the aſſeſſors to ſide with them, when as they are the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt among them.</p>
                  <p>And that I doe not ſpeake this without reaſon, your excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114151:56"/>will underſtand, if you will be pleaſed to enquire diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what tryals theſe your Miniſters have already made among your people. For ſome men notable for piety and goodneſſe have been commanded by them to abſtaine from the Supper, who could never yet know, why they were commanded this; but this ſeemed a ſufficient anſwer to thoſe new Lords of other mens faith, that they could not admit them with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Muſt therefore a godly man abſtain from the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and neglect his duty in preaching the benefit of Chriſts death, for the conſcience of a peeviſh and importunate Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? The Popiſh Biſhops are more tollerable towards us, who treely ſhew the cauſe why they account us Schiſmatics, &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates: neither doe they hinder us from clearing our ſelves: what ſhall we hope for then, when they have eſtabliſhed their Kingdome: Whereas the firſt fruits of their Diſcipline for which they ſo much quarrell, are ſuch?</p>
                  <p>I think it were much fitter, that Miniſters containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within their bounds, and that they leave to Magiſtrates what belongs to the Diſcipline of life and manners.</p>
                  <p>I know they object, that the Magiſtrate doth not alwayes his duty; and therefore there is need of another Senate, who may contain them within compaſſe. But I deny this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whereas they cannot prove what they ſay by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Prophericall or Apoſtolicall: It is indeed the Miniſters part to reprove the vices, and corrupt manners of Princes and Judges, to admoniſh them of their duty, as the Prophets did of bad. But I never yet read, that they ſhould ſubject them to any other Magiſtrate, to receive puniſhment or excommunication; becauſe they were negligent in their office, or offended by their old example: It is certaine the Prophets never did any ſuch thing. Of the Apoſtles we need not ſpeake, for in their time there were no <hi>Christian Magiſtrates,</hi> which was the cauſe of making blders in the Church that ſhould have inſpection of mens manners; which ought alſo to be done at this day under tyrannicall Perſecutors of the Faith. But there is a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reaſon of our Churches, who have by Gods ſpecial favour chriſtian Princes, which though they have their blemiſhes, yet
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114151:56"/>Miniſters ſhould maintain their authority, and not make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpectacles of them. [At laſt in the end of the ſame Epiſtle] This I rather wiſh, that the confuſion which is brought in by ſome Innovators, may by degrees be aboliſhed; which will bee eaſily done, if thoſe who are of a right &amp; moderate opinion, may be ſuffered to live quietly, and to propoſe their thoughts freely for others to judge. And let Divines be ſent away from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate, from medling with councels of Warre, &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the court to the Pulpit, and the Schooles, which is their, proper ground and wreſtling place.] There is yet another Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the ſame <hi>Gualter</hi> worth the noting: in which writing to <hi>Beza,</hi> he ſets down theſe heads of the whole controverſie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether the Lords Supper which hee calls the Symboll of communion, a joyfull and publike thankeſgiving, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of redemption performed to us, ſhould ſerve for excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and ſo be converted to another uſe, then what Chriſt hath ſhewed, or the Apoſtles delivered to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether ſuch as repent ſhould be for ſome time debarred from the uſe of it, when they deſire with the Church to declare the Lords death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether it is not ſufficient for him that comes to the Lords Table to prove himſelfe, and to finde in himſelfe a lively faith joyned with the ſpirit of ſerious contrition and repentance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether where there is a chriſtian Magiſtrate, there ought to be ſet up a Presbytery, wch may have power over the public Diſcipline of many, &amp; to remove fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cómunion whom they think have deſerved it? Theſe things, I ſay, ſeeme to be the chiefeſt which are controverted in this cauſe; for I ſuppoſe, we differ not about Infidels, the enemies of chriſtian Religion, &amp; impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſiners, whoſe incurable cn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacy is too wel known.</p>
                  <p>Now of the firſt, ſome not without cauſe doubt when they ſee how dangerous it hath been in all ages to abuſe Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, though with a good zeale; nor can I ſee, why out of that ſhould be made a tormenter of mens conſciences, which ſerves to preſerve and confirme Faith, and to comfort afflicted conſciences, and ſon theſe ends was ordained by God. I hope you will bear with us patiently, if in this we differ from you.] And a little after.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114151:57"/>
                  <p>In the ſecond held, there is yet a greater difficulty; for though we know that one ſhould be excluded, yet wee ſee no reaſon why he upon his repentance ſhould bee longer ſuſpended from the Communion; for ſeeing the Lords Supper is a publike thankſgiving, and belongs to the Confeſſion of Faith, we thinke it a hard caſe, that a Chriſtian ſhould be forbidden to doe that which in it ſelfe is juſt, holy, and a Chriſtians chiefe duty; you rely upon that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. of which, much may be ſaid, but for brevities ſake, I forbeare.</p>
                  <p>But let us yeeld, that ſuch an excommunication is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; yet by that place can be meant no longer time, then till he confeſſe his repentance, and acknowledging his fault, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire reconciliation with the Church: For he that ſaid, <hi>Let him be to thee, as a Publican and Heathen,</hi> the ſame commands us to forgive our offending brother ſeventy times ſeven times; by which precept, there the Church is bound I hope you will not deny; for there alſo, you will ſay, Excommunication is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>For why ſhould the Church which conſiſts only of Chriſtians, be more rigid in puniſhing of offences, then becomes private men? Or, by what reaſon ſhall ſhe call him a ſtranger, from the Lords Family, whom the Lord himſelfe of the Family hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into grace.</p>
                  <p>We would faine ſee ſome example, to prove that God will not preſently receive converted Penitents. Did not that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne publikely offend againſt his Father, his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the whole Family, yea againſt heaven it ſelfe? Did not he give ſcandall both at home &amp; abroad; yet upon his repentance, and confeſſion of his ſinne, his Father preſently pardons him, reſtores him to his former dignity, honours him being reſtored with the ring of reconciliation, and for him will have that fat Calfe killled, that hee might feaſt and rejoyce with his whole Family.</p>
                  <p>Why then ſhould we debarany longer from that joyfull and ſaving feaſt of the Church, thoſe that make the ſame confeſhon with her? why then ſhould we exact new ſatisfactions? But there is danger you'l ſay, leaſt they counterfeit repentance. I confeſſe it. But ſhall we avoid this danger, if whole yeares they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114151:57"/>be kept off from the Communion? Truly, no length of time will reclaime a wicked Hypocrite. Neither let us feare to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whileſt we imitate God the Fathers Gentleneſſe. If Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites deceive us, its to their own danger, they will to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eate and drinke damnation, we ſhall be blameleſſe.</p>
                  <p>But I beſeech you Brother, may not we our ſelves bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in our raſh zeale exclude him from the Supper, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly converted, Chriſt feedes with his owne body and bloud?</p>
                  <p>How unfitting is it, to caſt him into a new ſorrow whom the Sonne of God will have to rejoyce in him?</p>
                  <p>How ſhall we excuſe that rigidneſſe in rejecting him, whom the Lord receiveth into his armes?</p>
                  <p>Here ſurely we may fear, leſt wee be found companions of that naughty ſervant, who having obtained mercy of his Maſter, uſed his fellow ſervant hardly, &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>[And ſhortly after, what you write concerning ſetting up of <hi>Preſbyteries</hi> in Churches we will eaſily admit, where there is no Chriſtian Magiſtrate. For ſome there muſt be, by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they may be contained in their duty, who are apt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend leſt Religion bee expoſed to ſcorn among ſtrangers. But under Chriſtian Princes, this care will bee fitter and ſafer committed to them, who ſit at the ſterne of Government. And I know not how ſafe it may be, to create a new Magiſtrateſhip, for many inconveniences may follow, which are tedious now to renearſe.</p>
                  <p>But this I cannot diſſemble in the Palatinate, the greateſt ſcandals fell out by the fault of the Elders erected there. And who I pray, will endure ſuch cenſures hereafter, who ſuffered the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> an impure <hi>Sodomite,</hi> and a moſt peſtiferous calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator, to eſcape unpuniſhed, that hee might not be drawne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawfull Judges? For they thought it fit to proceede ſlowly, that they might be the Judges of that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this be not? Mans ambition truly is unſatiable, and few are found, who grow not inſolent, upon any power committed to them. And if we
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114151:58"/>will look upon ancient ſtories, we ſhall finde, that the greateſt and moſt dangerous ſcandals of the Church proceeded from the Biſhops and other Miniſters, which wee may now ſee in <hi>Germany,</hi> among the Lutheran ſuperintendants, who think they may do any thing, being armed with too much power; but what ſhal we hope of them, who in <hi>Heydelberg</hi> plead this cauſe: This one boldneſſe doth ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If then we feare leaſt a new tyrannie be ſet up in the Church upon theſe principles, who will ſay our fear, is without cauſe? But as I wrote elſe-where, wee will not hinder them to enjoy their own meaning, who thinke they can profitably uſe this forme of Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>We only tell them this, that they muſt not goe about to put, or to thruſt the ſame ſhooe upon every mans foot; and for a point yet in controverſie, and whoſe forme cannot bee every where the ſame, pull the Churches aſunder, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new controverſies, make themſelves ridiculous to the common-enemy.]</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, ſerves that which <hi>Bullinger</hi> wrote in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Epiſtle to <hi>Peter Dathenus;</hi> where amongſt many other paſſages, he writes thus:</p>
                  <p>[What we think, and what we have ever thought of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſcipline, you cannot be ignorant; whereas we have brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched it, in that confeſſion of the <hi>Helvetian Churches,</hi> but lately publiſhed, wee never taught that there ſhould bee no Church Diſcipline at all, which we confeſſe to be needful.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the manner and way of this Diſcipline, all men are not, nor have not been of the ſame opinion. Our Church never mingled Chriſts myſticall Supper with Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: neither hath ſhe been (for ought I know) therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of impiety by any one: neither had we ever a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or any ſuch Eccleſiaſtick Senate which examined Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, or admitted to the Communion, or excluded from it ſinners; thoſe I mean, who by their comming to the Supper, after ſerious and grave admonitions, do as it were promiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114151:58"/>of life, and deſire to give thankes with all their hearts for their redemption. We think that wicked men, and ſuch as offend the Church ſhould be curbed ſome other way, and amended. For we ſuppoſe, and believe, that the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was inſtituted by him not to be a Fan, or ſive to ſift and winnow men one from another, but to be a <hi>Synaxis,</hi> that is a coagmentation ſociety communion, and conjunction, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and gather together ſinners, I meane thoſe, who feele the burthen of their ſins and confeſſe them, and beleeve that they are pardoned by Chriſts death; therefore now they come to the Supper to thank him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This opinion, brother, ſhould not ſeeme to you a novelty lately deviſed by us, whereas in High <hi>Germany</hi> the Church of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> which hath been accounted the chiefe of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hath alwayes been of this opinion; ſhe began to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the year 1519.] and afterwards [as for that worthy man <hi>Zuinglius</hi> of bleſſed memory, the firſt reſtorer of theſe <hi>Helvetian Churches,</hi> he hath left us nothing to be exercized in this Church, which wee have not carefully obſerved till this day: neither did we ever ſtudy to bring in changes or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Church-matters, knowing what dangers may hence ariſe among the People, how many ſcandals &amp; ſchiſms may hence proceed, and how this would give occaſion to our Adverſaries to reproach us.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> would never mingle the myſticall Supper with Eccleſiaſticke Diſcipline; Hee would never turne that gratulatory Supper of the Lord, and joyfull commemoration of mans redemption, into a ſad puniſhment of ſuch ſinners, who confeſſing their ſinnes, make haſt to go to Chriſt, whom they beleeve to have obtained pardon for them, by delivering up his body, and ſhedding of his blood, and beleeving this, that he invites them to this ſacred and myſticall Supper.</p>
                  <p>He added, that it is ſufficiently known, what Gueſts Chriſt admitted to his firſt Supper, which was doubtleſſe the moſt abſolute of all. And that it it unfitting we ſhould be quicker ſighted then the Son of GOD himſelf, who perfectly knowes the hearts of the Sonnes of MEN alone; Or, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114151:59"/>we ſhould otherwiſe judge of his Supper, then we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or example from him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He touched ſome thing of this matter in his friendly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Luther,</hi> in the 2. Tome of his Workes, <hi>fol.</hi> 359.6.] and in the progreſſe of the ſame Epiſtle: <q>[Neither, ſaith hee, doth <hi>Muſculus</hi> vary a whit from this, who was an excellent Inſtrument of Chriſt, and a famous Doctor of the Church, Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Berne,</hi> and Profeſſor of Divinity. For what he wrote of Church-Diſcipline in his common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Title of the Miniſter of Gods Word, is known to all. Out of all this it is cleere that in this matter I differ not in opinion, either from <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or from the Churches or Doctors of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, who either now live, or have lived, in governing of the Church, theſe 50 yeares, &amp;c.]</q> Theſe are the teſtimonies of Divines, which I thought good to ſet down at large; not that I ſeek for any help from them, to confirme this truth, but becauſe I was willing to ſhew, that if this cauſe were to be defined by the votes of learned men, there are not wanting many of the prime and moſt excellent Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who hitherto fore have maintained the ſame opinion with us, &amp; have affirmed the ſame things, which I have defended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready againſt the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> and will defend yet, except I be convinced by better arguments out of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>For this is evident, that theſe <hi>Walachrian</hi> whirle-windes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not certainly what they write; but as they are infected with pride and ſuperſtition; that is, with Antichriſtian poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that I may put an end at laſt to this Diſcourſe, I will gather together theſe <hi>Walachrian</hi> Popiſh Keyes of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> into a bundle, and with the reſt of Antichriſtian traſh, whence theſe were taken, I will fling them into a corner, left this <hi>Treverian,</hi> like another tragicall ſurie, go on to hurt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace (as he hath begun) all Chriſtians, and chiefly Godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
               <p>The right of making Lawes, hath affinitie with the power of cenſuring. For cenſure hath place only upon Delinquents; there is no Delinquency, but againſt the Lawes. Therefore, that theſe Hierarchicall men might take occaſion to uſe their cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114151:59"/>power enough againſt Chriſtians divers Lawes like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny traps, were to be propoſed to them, which being tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the cenſuring power might be exerciſed.</p>
               <p>Thus the Pope maintaines his tyrannie: he hath long ſince preſcribed ſo many Lawes to Chriſtians, that neither the whole Bible nor the body of the Civill-Law are to be compared to the Popes decrees, it is impoſſible for men to live, without fault or other. Hence proceeds the Popes right of puniſhing, and then his bounty in pardoning, whereby hee remits, and diſpenſes with the penalty, but firſt money muſt be payed, and they that hath eyes may ſee, that this Antichriſtian ſhop is artificially ſurniſhed for the Popes honour and profit.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Stilt-Walker</hi> hath finely learned the ſame mechanicall way of cheating, out of his Inſtitutions: for not only doth hee vent the corrupted power of his Church-cenſure; but becauſe he perceived that he could have no occaſion to cenſure, except there were many Lawes againſt which Chriſtians might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: Hence, above other things, he ſtrives to maintain the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſanctity, of the power in making Lawes: of which, I will diſcourſe a little.</p>
               <p>And firſt note the mans giddineſſe, which like a Leproſie, hee hath drawn from the Jeſuites, in ſometimes affirming, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denying the ſame thing, either out of forgetfulneſſe, or impudence. For in many places he maintaines, that the Church hath power to make Lawes, which Chriſtians are with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to obſerve; which power, hee ſaith is holy, and ſo free, that Chriſt ſhed his bloud for it, and cryes out, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will become ſacrilegious, if hee hinder Church-men in this.</p>
               <p>And elſe-where alſo he doth fiercely and in plain tearmes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that the Church hath no right to make Lawes. For, ſaith he, the ſervant ought not to make lawes for the Family, but the Maſter himſelf.] Who ſeeth not here, I and nay, and a plaine contradiction? I confeſſe, this our old cheater is not ſo ſimple, as not to uſe meanes by a frivolous ſeavill to eſcape; for hee addes, <hi>[that the Church Lawes, are not properly Lanes]</hi> but onely Statutes or Ordinances, which art hee learned out of the ſame School of the Pope; who being that whore in the Revelation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114151:60"/>clokes by her whoriſh impudence, her impurity and hithineſſe with honeſt pretences.</p>
               <p>It is ordinary with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to call Idolatry <hi>veneration of the Saints,</hi> the Popes tyrannie, <hi>Peters paſtorall power,</hi> and ſo boundleſſe is the Popes impudence, that though in his Feſtival perambulation he ſhines with Gold and Jewels, yet hee cryes out openly, <hi>Gold and Silver have</hi> I <hi>none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe our <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is but a Dwarſe to the Pope; yet in this as in other things, he imitates him: to that het ſpeakes one thing, but thinkes and beleevet another thing.</p>
               <p>For though hee confeſſe, that his Lawes are not properly Lawes, yet hee knowes that hee ſpeakes this only <hi>(pro forma)</hi> to delude the credulous.</p>
               <p>For in truth he thinkes, and with tooth and naile maintaine, that his Eccleſiaſticke Statutes and Ordinances, by what milde name ſoever he calls them are to be held for Lawes. For becauſe they preſcribe to Chriſtians under moſt grievovs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what they muſt doe, or not doe, as I will hereafter ſhew, who ſeeth not, that theſe Ordinances have the nature of Lawes?</p>
               <p>So that he playes the cunning <hi>Iougler,</hi> in venting abroad his Holineſſe.</p>
               <p>For amongſt other Artifices wherein theſe cheating <hi>Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or <hi>Regraters</hi> doe abound this is one that walking in the darke under a Vizard or Vaile, which they can turne as they will: they uſe when they pleaſe to increaſe and leſſen their Greatneſſe in a minute, ſo that they deceive the moſt cunning men that are, as that they can ſcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e think this to bee the ſame perſon which they ſee.</p>
               <p>If it were the purpoſe of this <hi>VValachrian,</hi> to learne this art of theſe Knaves, I confeſſe he is a ready Scholler, and deſerves to weare <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> breeches in their Schoole. But that he may not deceive the too credulous by this art, in heightning and ſhortning ſuddenly the ſanctity of his Lawes, I will in few words expedite matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I affirme that Church-men, ſuch as they are now, have he legiſlative power in Church-buſineſſes, that is, to make Lawes, properly ſo called.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:114151:60"/>
               <p>Neither is it materiall, whether here we call them Lawes or Statutes: for Statutes are Lawes,
<q>When they prohibite, puniſh, promiſe, command, and obliege all to obſerve them.</q> But the failing of obſervation preſuppoſeth a penalty. Hence it is cleere, that hee only hath power to make laws who hath power only to puniſh the breakers of Lawes.</p>
               <p>Hence this whole legiſlative power is called <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> which conſiſts in conſtituting, that is, in making and executing the Law.</p>
               <p>So that it is a common Maxime among Lawyers, that hee only hath this power, who is inveſted with majeſty, and the ſupreame power.] For,
<q>the Law is a decree of ſupreame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and there is no conſtitution of Lawes, without the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of puniſhing and executing; without Empire or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality there is no juriſdiction.]</q> For they who can onely judge, and have no power to execute (ſuch is inferiour Judges) they want juriſdiction. <hi>l.</hi> 5.15. <hi>D. de re jud. l. ſin. c. ubi, &amp; apud quem cogu. in int. reſt.</hi> By which we may ſee what a troubler and confounder of the world the Power is, who hath produced ſuch Monſters: So that hee hath made the Emperour a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and an Inferiour to judge the Emperor; for hee hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to himſelfe the higheſt Pawn in Church-matters, and under this pretext, to judge and determine of Magiſtrates. But that he may not defile his Church-ſanctity, hee abſtaines from execution, and the uſe of the ſword: he carryes it indeed, and ſhewes it to Princes, as it were upbraiding them, that hee hath ſnatch it from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet of himſelf he doth not draw, except very ſeldome, but commands Kings to draw it, when he pleaſeth. Thus he grants Kings power to execute, but hath ſnatcht from them the power of judging and ordaining. So that now the Prince being diveſted of all power of judging, wanders up and down like a great Hang-man or Gyant, being armed onely for this end, that hee might ſerve the Pope, that moſt monſtrous Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> the Pope Ape in every thing, flyers with the ſame wings. He confeſſeth that he is ſubject to Princes, but not in Church-matters; For in theſe hee claimes right to make
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114151:61"/>Lawes, even for Magiſtrates, which they muſt be bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and to ſubmit themſelves; and if they obey not, he ſaith, that he is armed with divine power of cenſuring and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. But if one take the boldneſſe, to deny obedience to the Statutes and Penalties, that then the Magiſtrate is bound in duty to aſſiſt the Church-men with his ſword, at whoſe beck, he muſt draw it, to puniſh the refractory, that they may keepe the Churches ſtatutes: Who ſeeth not here, the idea of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Among all Godly men it is beleeved, that it belongs only to God to make lawes concerning things neceſſary to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Salvation.</p>
               <p>For as God every where examines obedience; ſo chiefly in his worſhip he will have us to adhere to his Lawes onely: So that he accounts it ſtupendious boldneſſe for any to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</note> according to mens precepts.</p>
               <p>He is ſo rigid in this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa</hi> 29.13</note> that he will not only have the ſubſtance of his Worſhip, but the very Rites and circumſtances to bo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved according to his preſcript, as wee may ſee by the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, who being returned home from the captivity, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Lyons,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 17</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe they worſhipped not God,</hi> and yet it is ſaid there, that they did worſhip God; whence it appears, that they obſerved the ſubſtance, but neglected the rites and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his worſhip: For which cauſe, Prieſts were ſent from <hi>Babylon,</hi> who might teach them the Rites of his Worſhip better, by which meanes they were delivered from the Lyons. So it is cleere, that the whole ſubſtance, and neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of divine worſhip, muſt be ſought onely from the mouth of God, and his commands.</p>
               <p>And becauſe wee can conſult with God no where but in the Scripture, it is evident, that nothing can be taken for Law, or divine inſtitution, neceſſary for ſalvation, but what is in plaine tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes ſet down in Scripture. So that the Church hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer legiſlative at all, except in things not neceſſary and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: to which I will preſcribe theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let not any Rites and Ceremonies be uſed in Divine Worſhip, which doe not plainly agree with Gods Word, and with that order and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114151:61"/>decencie fit for ſuch a Worſhip.</hi> The Pope here makes <hi>Religious Intentions</hi> his rules, by which pretext he increaſeth dayly cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to that number that by them hee oppreſſeth Chriſtians, and exalts himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> delirous to imitate this Papall power in multiplying Lawes, preſcribes alſo the ſame Rule; which is ſo large and looſe, that he can dayly delight himſelfe with dreams of new Lawes and Rites, which hee may belch out and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to his People, that hee may upbraid their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but here and elſe-where he contradicts himſelf; for he is ſo rigid, <hi>that he calls it Superſtition, to make any act to be of holy uſe, or to give it place in Divine Worſhip, without a Divine Law.</hi> Which I impute either to the mans giddineſſe, or to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he hath to deceive.</p>
               <p>For if hee admit of no act in Religion, but what is plainely contained in Scripture: Why doth hee under paine of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge keepe off Religious Magiſtrates, from making of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Lawes, in calling them ſacrilegious, if they offer to make Lawes for the Church, without Church-mens aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Is it not lawfull for pious Princes to command men, that they obſerve Chriſts Lawes and Ordinances ſet downe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Is there ſuch oddes, whether this be enjoyned by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or Church-men, ſo it be agreeable to Chriſts Lawes? For the <hi>Treverian</hi> prates openly elſe-where, that Magiſtrates muſt not make Church Lawes, becauſe they ſhould bee made by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall juriſdiction. So that neceſſarily ſome myſtery of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality muſt lye hid in Church-men, that the ſame Lawes of the ſame things (whether theſe things bee neceſſary or indifferent) may become ſpirituall, if they be given from ſpiritual; that is, Church-men, but profaine if given by Godly Magiſtrates. This the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> did not learne from <hi>Calvin,</hi> but of the Jeſuires, who are wont to begge much of the ſpirituall ſanctity of their Churches. So that <hi>Calvin</hi> eloquently taxeth them for this; whoſe words I here ſubjoyne, <hi>By this pretence, falſe Biſhops doe burthen conſciences with new Lawes, that they are spirituall Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114151:62"/>appointed by God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſt q.</hi> 10. <hi>ſ.</hi> 6.</note> ſince the government of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Apolonius</hi> may ſee his diſeaſe much like the Popiſh Scab. It is well knowne for what end the Pope doth ſtrive ſo much for this ſpirituality in making Lawes. For hee would not ſeeme to be the man he is, to wit, Antichriſt and the deſtroyer of his Maſters Lawes.</p>
               <p>But by pretending ſpirituality, hee challengeth to himſelfe power to declare what is properly agreeing to Chriſts Lawes, what not,</p>
               <p>But in ſaying, this doth not belong to Lay-men, how can hee prove it; when Chriſt ſaith, Drinke ye all of this: Hee ſaith, Drink not all of this. CHRIST ſaith to the People, ſearch the Scripture. Hee ſaith, ſearch them not, under paine of death.</p>
               <p>Again, Marriage is honourable among all men; the Pope ſaith, it is diſhonourable, and more unlawfull among Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then Fornication.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch Lawes hath the Pope given us out of the Holy Scripture. But by the helpe of his interpreting Spirituality. The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> hath publikely manifeſted that he underſtands alſo that Maxime, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the actions of Divine Worſhip are to bee taken onely out of Gods Law,</hi> to wit.</p>
               <p>According to the POPES Dialect, that <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and ſuch Spirituall men as he onely, are to explaine, <hi>what is properly to be taken out of Gods Law.</hi> But civill Magiſtrates muſt have no hand in this.</p>
               <p>This is the new myſterie of iniquity, which theſe <hi>walachrian</hi> Jouglers are breeding; that by the priviledge of their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preaching, to them onely muſt belong this ſpirituall legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative power, of preclaiming Lawes and Statutes every day, not againſt or beſides Scripture.</p>
               <p>(For this were a diſgrace to theſe new Papiſts) but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114151:62"/>yet conditionally, that under pain of ſacriledge, no Lay-men preſume to enquire into thoſe holy Church-lawes, at leaſt not to ordaine, or being ordained, to abbrogate them of themſelves. For it is not the part of a good ſonne, thus to enquire into his Fathers actions; but to obey the Lawes however preſcribed, as being ſpirituall, and given by ſpirituall men. If once godly Magiſtrates ſuffer themſelves to be blinded with this efficacie of errour, in a ſhort time (as under the Pope) by pretending holy Scripture, all kinds of falſhoods will bee obtruded upon them: that if the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> doth not act his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in <hi>Walachria,</hi> as <hi>Becholitus</hi> did at <hi>Monaſter;</hi> yet at leaſt in out confederate Provinces, hee muſt have two ſeparated formes of government, whereof the one muſt be independent from the other; yea repugnant in contrary lawes. That theſe things are intended by our new Papiſts, under their ſpirituall liberty of the legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is moſt apparent, as I have ſhewed already.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not enough to adhere to the Scripture in ordaining new ceremonies of divine worſhip; but the Church muſt now take heed that ſhe be not too liberall in inventing of ſuch. For as man naturally grows proud by greatneſs of ſpirit; ſo of mean &amp; dejected ſpirits, ariſeth <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> &amp; then <hi>wil-worſhip;</hi> and if we be not wary, at laſt <hi>idolatry.</hi> For ſeldome here is there a mean kept, but men goe from one degree to another; which <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth in the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who going about to betray the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> liberty, they firſt enjoyned them <hi>not to eat:</hi> then higher, <hi>taſt not:</hi> laſtly, <hi>touch not,</hi> For it is more ſtrictneſſe to abſtain from <hi>touching,</hi> then from <hi>taſting:</hi> and again, from <hi>taſting</hi> then from eating: ſo we ſee in Popery, that of ſmall beginnings, and thoſe not evill, have ariſen ceremonies, which ſtill increaſing, are become a yoke more heavie then that of the Jews. If the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis did not earneſtly deſire this, they would not be ſo hot in urging a ſacred and ſpirituall liberty, to preſcribe lawes to the Church.</p>
               <p>The third thing that I would have to be obſerved, is, that lawes be not too rigorous: for they are only of things indifferent; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concern not religion, but order only, &amp; changeable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which to urge with ſuch imperiouſneſſe, is not the part of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of a tyrant. An example of greater moderation cannot bee had, then that which is extant in the Apoſtolicall Church. For when they were all aſſembled at Jeruſalem to deliberate about the peace and lawes of the Church, although they had full power,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</note> yet they uſed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114151:63"/>ſo little rigour and authority, that they determined, or ordained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but by the conſent and decree of the whole body of the Church: And they uſed ſuch moderation in giving Lawes to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Churches, that they did as it were by an intreating way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them, and left in a manner freedome to every Church to obſerve, and to abrogate them when they became needleſſe; as I will ſhew in that which followes. Hee that ſeeth <hi>Paul</hi> ordaining rites and ceremonies, will eaſily obſerve, that he was carefull of nothing more, then that the conſciences of Chriſtians might not be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the yoak of Lawes. For thus he ſayth, <hi>This I ſay, not the Lord: of this I have no precept, This I ſay to you, not by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but of counſell: judge you if it be decent:</hi> So at laſt he concludes, that nothing was more averſe from his cuſtome, or the cuſtome of Apoſtolicall Churches, then to ſtrive eagerly, or too imperiouſly in commanding rites or ceremonies: as even then preſaging the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintering pride of Church-men, which hee would ſhake off, and teach Chriſtians moderation in the obſervation of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo that it is to be admired, how mens perverſe heat of ruling cannot be curbed by his example and admonitions; ſo as not onely mean men, but ſome of great worth, have been carried headlong with too much heat. A notable example of this we may ſee in <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> recorded by <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> He was ſo much moved at the wearing of a Surpluſſe, Biſhops Cap, and other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, (which were the Reliques of Popery then in <hi>England</hi>) that he threatned to forſake his Biſhoprick; whoſe prepoſterous ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy learned <hi>Martyr</hi> appeaſed in a moſt wiſe Tract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worthy Calvin</hi> himſelf when he was firſt called to <hi>Geneva,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo eagerly with his Magiſtrates about the circumſtance of unle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread in the Lords Supper, to ſhew his averſneſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> that rather then he would yeeld, ſuffered himſelf and his Colleagues to be baniſhed from thence: but of this he repented afterward, which he did ſhew, when hee warned the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other Churches afterward by his writings, not to ſtrive about that or any other ceremonies.</p>
               <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to theſe Rules, be examined, it will eaſily appeare, that hee is Antichriſt: For not onely without Scrripture, doth he burthen Chriſtians with innumerable decrees and lawes; but he is ſo rigid in maintenance of his Lawes, that hee is more ſeverely puniſhed for the moſt part, who denieth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114151:63"/>to his Statutes, then he that tranſgreſſeth Gods expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> followes him cloſe at the heeles, whilſt he doth ſo eagerly contend for the right of making Church-lawes; ſo that he cries out, Chriſts blood, and all holy things to be prophaned, if this power be granted to Lay-men, or if Church-men in this be any wayes hindered. For who but an Impoſtor will goe about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that there is ſuch a myſticall holineſſe in ordaining things indifferent; as whether we may pray covered or uncovered; ſtanding, kneeling, or ſirting? with our eyes looking upward or downward? what day the congregation muſt meet? whether early or late? in what place, &amp; in what garments muſt men pray and preach? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at night (after Chriſts example) or by day, the communion muſt be given? whether the wine muſt bee powred out into ſilver or glaſſe? whether levened or unlevened bread muſt be uſed? whether onely the Preacher muſt give the Sacraments, or the Elders alſo, and any religious man as it was in uſe among the Apoſtles? whether he only is to preach that is called by impoſition of hands, or others alſo, who ſometimes are better able, though accounted but Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? whether the right of conſecration, that is, of impoſition of hands, belongs onely to the Miniſter, or to all the Elders alſo, and other members of the Church; ſo that confuſion be avoided, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other things, which touch not the ſubſtance, nor neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rites of divine worſhip; in ordaining of which, whereas there is nothing ſo eminent, but may not be determined eaſily by lay-men, as they call them, eſpecially by civill Magiſtrates, yet he ſo ſwels with the pretended ſanctity of this unſpeakable myſtery, that he wil have us bleeve, they overthrow religion and piety, who think or doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in this, then he pleaſeth. Beſides, in this alſo hee imitates the Pope, for that he is almoſt more rigid in arguing and venting his Eccleſiaſtick Lawes, then thoſe that are truly Divine. This hee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids elſwhere to the Pope, as Antichriſtian; but in this he runs from the Limepit, and falls ſtill into the Coal-pit; or as wee ſay, he leaps out of the frying-pan into the fire: For they ſay that it is ordinary for this <hi>Treverian</hi> to beget new dreames, eſpecially ſuch as ſerve for eſtabliſhing the majeſty of the Church, and treading downe that of the State; in which hee is ſo zealous, that hee contends more about the not obſervation of Chriſts Nativity, and other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall dayes, about driving the Harmony of Organs out of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114151:64"/>Church, about the moſt ſpirituall holineſſe of Deaconſhip, and other trifles, then he is about the whole paſſion of Chriſt, or urging of his merits; ſo that a whore doth not ſcold more againſt an honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then hee doth againſt both Magiſtrates and Miniſters, if they croſſe him in his trifles. On the contrary, he offends not that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Magiſtrates openly or privatly, though he be never ſo infamous, ſeditious, an extortioner, a cheater, and the ſink of all wickedneſſe. Yet he is not ſo cunning in hiding his Popiſh leproſie, but the ſcabs which he covers in one place, he diſcovers in another. He inveighs much againſt the Pope for making ſuch lawes as bind Chriſtian mens conſciences; and yet (ſuch is his giddineſſe) not only doth he laviſhly extoll the ſanctity of Legiſlative power, but every where ſo prates of the neceſſity of his lawes, that he openly matcheth them with the Lawes of Chriſt. For he cries out, that the Lawes and Statutes of the Church at this day, are of ſuch authority, that if any refuſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, he is to be puniſhed with the greater and leſſer cenſure by the Church: which every man my ſee toucheth mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For what more grievous puniſhment can he denounce againſt a whoremaſter, an adulterer, a Blaſphemer, and an open deſpiſer of divine lawes, but to puniſh him with his cenſuring Rod, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. Beſides, there can be no greater puniſhment, then to be excluded from heaven; but if we will credit <hi>Apolonius,</hi> he is excluded from heaven whom he excommunicates.</p>
               <p>I beleeve the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> laughs here within himſelf, as often as he affeights ſimple men, with the terrours of his cenſure; which hee knowes to be mockeries, and uſed by him for no other end, then to reigne over mens eſtates, bodies and conſciences. But I now eſteem of this thing as it is, and as each holy man can judge of it. Surely, if the greater excommunication be the puniſhment of Eccleſiaſtick lawes, if excommunication be the Key that truly ſhuts heaven, as the <hi>Walachrians</hi> ſay; who ſees not that the conſcience is touched with this, when he ſhall find that heaven is locked againſt him with the <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Stilt-wakers</hi> Key, except he will ſubſcribe to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and devices of the <hi>Walachrians?</hi> I confeſſe <hi>Apolonius</hi> is not ſo unskilfull an actor in this Papall Stage-play, but he can with a fine diſtinction cleare himſelfe of this blemiſh: for he ſayth, <hi>That puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not inflicted for a Law, or thing which is indifferent, but for contumacie:</hi> As if a Magiſtrate ſhould ſay, that the murtherer is not executed for cutting the innocent mans throat, but becauſe he died
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114151:64"/>y upon it. But I deny that this is contumacy, when one reſiſts ſtoutly and conſtantly the idle devices of Church-men, whether they be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded by <hi>Apolonius,</hi> or the <hi>Walashrians,</hi> or the <hi>Pope;</hi> there was never ſuch authority in a lyer, as to make a lye become a truth. Therefore when the Church obtrudes a falſhood, or commands a thing indifferent, as neceſſary, becauſe ſhe deceiveth, he is not contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious, who in this caſe reſiſteth the Church; but the Church is contumacious herſelfe, which perſeveres in her falſhoods. So this <hi>Walachrian Mom:</hi> is alwayes dancing upon the Popes Scaffold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the borders or fringes, not onely of his preaching and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but alſo of his legiſlative garment, ſo farre, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that he offends as grievouſly, who obeyes not the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word and decrees of his Church, as he that reſiſteth the plain O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt. He feignes that there is an unſeparable ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between himſelfe and other modern preachers of his ſtamp, and Chriſts; and conſequently, ſuch a ſelfe-commanding and imperious power of teaching and charging Gods people, with no leſſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then if Chriſt himſelfe commanded; ſo that it is commmon with theſe pratlers, to perſwade men with the Pope, <hi>That they heare Chriſt who hear them, and reject Chriſt, who reject them.</hi> That the <hi>Stilt-wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> may ſee this raſh aſſertion to be taken out the Popes Schoole, hee ſhall doe well to ſhake his moſt inward theologicall Budget, and to free himſelfe of this circle and labyrinth, which here I will interlace; and becauſe I ſhall touch here the crown both of old and new Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I will ſo compoſe my ſelfe to gravity, as that I ſhall ſeem to jeſt in a matter of ſo great weight as this. For I will ask, whether hee that heares <hi>Apolonius</hi> teaching and commanding, heares alwayes Chriſt? If he affirmes this, then he will be Pope, and infallible: If he denies this (for out of this his book we know that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> teacheth many falſhoods;) then I wil ask further, when ſhal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be certain that <hi>Apolonius</hi> ſpeaks truth? He wil anſwer, that then, when he ſpeakes according to Scripture. Well, but I will ask again, Whether he ſpeake alwayes according to Scripture? If he ſayth I, then he is Pope and infallible: If he ſayth no; then I aske again, When doth he ſpeak according to Scripture? Hee will anſwer, that then, when according to his skill in languages, hee weighes the Phraſes, &amp; ſearches out the circumſtances of place, and clears all by parallell places. Very good: But I ask a again, whether <hi>Apolonius</hi> doth this alwayes well? If he ſayth I, then he is Pope, &amp; infallible: if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114151:65"/>I will ask again, when ſhall we know, that <hi>Apolonius</hi> doth well? He will anſwer, that then, when he ſtudieth, diligently, and prayeth devoutly: for we muſt hope, that then God aſſiſts him, that he may not deviate from the truth.</p>
               <p>But here a double queſtion will ariſe. Firſt, how it is knowne that he alwayes preacheth and prayeth well? For he that reads theſe his patched peeces, will finde, that a great part of his prayers and paines are intended to overthrow the civill Magiſtrate, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to himſelfe rule and command in the Church: but I will yeeld, that good <hi>Apolonius</hi> doth all things well. I will ask then again, if he (though he pray and labour well) doth alwayes preach truth? If he doth, then he is infallible, as the Pope: If he doth not, I will ask again, How may we certainly know, that <hi>Apolonius</hi> whilſt hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth and prayeth, hath the infallible grace of the Spirit? God no where in Scripture promiſeth this to <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and our modern Law-givers. This indeed was true in the divinely-inſpired Apoſtles and Prophets; but that this is true in the Pope, is the lye of <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and all his Jeſuits: And if this <hi>Walachrian Pompion</hi> ſhould preſume to brag ſo much of himſelfe, his owne booke would refute him; in writing of which, though he laboured moſt ſpiritually, yet it is plain, that he hath in it uttered many blaſphemous and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lies. Here then having catched him, I will hold him faſt, and wil convince him of fraud, in ſaying, that Chriſts commands are obeyed when he is obeyed commanding (as he ſayth) in Chriſts Name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he will fall into this abſurdity, in ſaying, that he who heares <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonius</hi> lying, heares Chriſt in <hi>Apolonius</hi> commanding, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he will think is blaſphemy. Hence then it is cleare, that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> is a deceiver, who would perſwade the credulous, that his own and his <hi>Walachrian</hi> Eccleſiaſtick Dictates and Commands, are to be accounted the Dictates and commands of Chriſt, whereas Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot be certainly induced to beleeve this, upon any ſure ground; Yea, it is certain, both by theſe <hi>Walachrian</hi> ſayings &amp; writings, that Chriſt ſpeakes not in them; for he is alwayes true, and theſe are full of lies and blaſphemies, but rather the ſpirit of Antichriſt, who is a lier. But here is one hole, through which he may eſcape; hee will ſay, perhaps, that he ſubmits his preaching to the judgement of the Conſiſtory; and becauſe what <hi>Apolonius</hi> there determines, is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſo many Prophets, it is very juſt that the ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets be ſubject to the Prophets, and ſo the people muſt beleeve <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonius</hi> propheſying.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:114151:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But here again I ask, whether all is truth that is determined by the Conſiſtory of <hi>Middleburgh?</hi> If he affirmes it, then this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory is infallible, as the Pope: If he denies it, I will ask, how he knowes that the Conſiſtory doth not erre? He will anſwer, that he knowes it by the approbation of the whole <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſes: (for thus hath he proceeded in canonizing his patcht book.) But I ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whether that be infallible, what the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth? If hee affirmes it, their this Claſſis is infallible as the Pope: (But I doe not think that then other Claſſes of <hi>Zealand</hi> will yeeld this to the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Spirituality, that whatſoever they determine, muſt be infallible.) If he denies this, then I ask again, How ſhall I know that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis doth not erre? He will ſay, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if all the other Claſſes of <hi>Zealand,</hi> that is, the Synod, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, I will ask him, If whatſoever the Synod of <hi>Zealand</hi> ſhall determine, be infallible? I beleeve the Synod of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of the other Provinces, will deny this; nor will they acknowledge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall infallibility of the Synod of <hi>Zealand.</hi> From hence, perhaps, hee will aſcend to the Synod of all the Provinces, then to the Nationall, after, to the Generall, and laſt of all he will mount up <hi>in infinitum:</hi> So that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will find no out-let, except hee conclude in the Pope alone, to whoſe judgement we muſt ſubmit, whether hee erre or not, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> becauſe he is ſubject to no mans autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and correction, but is to bee left to Chriſts judgement alone, which ſhall bee in the end of the world. The <hi>Walachrians</hi> every where breathe this Antichriſtian ſpirit, who though conſcious of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility and error, yet are ſtill crying out, that obedience muſt be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their Church-ordinances, under pain of excommunication. They confeſſe indeed, that they are not infallible, and permit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to examine their doctrines and ordinances; but yet will not have the Magiſtrates to abrogate or appoynt any thing, except the Clergy refuſe to be reformed. The judgement of which eaſe muſt remain in Clergy-men: ſo in truth, opinion, and Popiſh perſwaſion is the very foundation of this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Legiſlative power: thus all by an implicit faith muſt beleeve, that their governours how ever at other times they may erre, yet now they doe not erre; or if they do erre, yet they muſt not be reſiſted by the modeſt ſonnes of the Church, but obeyed. Surely this opniion differs much from that moderation of the Apoſtles, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtians abſolutly were bound to beleeve, by reaſon of their infallibility: yet the one did not abſolutely
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114151:66"/>beleeve, nor did the other abſolutely require it, but ſubmitted their doctrine and ordinances to every ones examination: ſo that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, that a rabble of unskilfull fellowes at this day, ſhould do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere over the Clergy, and by divine right, forſooth, enſlave Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mens conſciences to yeeld obedience to their toyes.</p>
               <p>But here I will remove one ſeruple, which hath much troubled the minds even of ſome good Schollers.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> The Apoſtle wills <hi>every ſoule to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate for conſcience ſake;</hi> and hee warnes us <hi>to hearken and obey the Governours of the Church.</hi> Hence they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, if the Magiſtrates lawes can bind the conſcience, whereby God will have us obey them; then the Church laws alſo muſt bind Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſciences: for them alſo we are enjoyned to obey. If I were to cut this knot, I would ſay that there is great oddes between theſe two commands: for the holy Ghoſt in plain tearmes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every ſoule to obey the civill Magiſtrate for conſcience ſake. As for Church-Rulers, he commands honour and obedience to bee given to them; but he doth not enjoyne every ſoule to this, nor for conſcience ſake. For thoſe reſtrictions the maintainers of Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Whence proceeds ſo great a change in the ſumme, that they are quite miſtaken in the reckoning. But my prime anſwer ſhall he this, There is great difference between the obedience due to civill Magiſtrates, and to Church-governours: For God hath appoynted the former to be his Embaſſadours and Vicars upon earth, and Gods in his name; under which Tittle hee give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> them this power, that not onely every ſoule, but alſo for conſcience, is bound to obey them, that is, abſolutely, not onely as they command juſtly, and lawfully, but as they command: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath armed them with the ſword, that they may force men. For if the civill Magiſtrate command things, either juſt or Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the ſubject is bound to obey for conſcience. If hee commands what is unjuſt, the ſubiect is not bound to performe, but to ſubmit either by ſuffering the puniſhment, or by flight; but the obedience due to Church-Rulers is farre other: for they are not to bee obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely, becauſe they command, but conditionally, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand lawfully.</p>
               <p>For theſe Spirituall Rulers muſt be tried if they are of God, or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114151:66"/>not: For if they enter not in at the doore, the ſtraight way, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, by a back-doore, become Shepheards, Captaines and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, they are not to be obeyed, but reiected as hirelings and wolves. Again, if they enter in lawfully, ſo that they ſit with the Scribes in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chaire, and yet wil mingle the leven of their Traditions, they are to be avoyded as blind guides: yea, [to be caſt out as unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſalt, and to be trod under foot.] Chriſt himſelfe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as I will hereafter ſhew more fully: ſo that here now we may ſee another Legiſlative Divinity, quite different from that of the old and new Papiſts: for the Pope hath long ſince perſwaded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that every ſoule muſt be ſubject to him (even of Princes) as to the univerſal Steward of the Church, and that for conſcience ſake, they are bound to obey his Edicts abſolutely; for which end hee hath armed himſelfe alſo with the temporal ſword (for he carries two) that he may ſhew himſelfe to be the tranſcendent ſword-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of <hi>Paul,</hi> by which right he claimes to himſelfe ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power in the Church, that though ſometimes <hi>he creeps in like a Fox, and reignes as a Lion;</hi> yet he will bee abſolutely obeyed, <hi>till he die like a Dogge.</hi>) The ſame is the ground of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: For the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> doth not on this lay the foundation of ſpeciall and divine right of law-giving, that hee is a lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and commands things lawful, (for ſo he ſhould be ſubiect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans examination;) but upon this priviledge, that hee is the Captain, Leader, Shepheard, and Embaſſadour of Chriſt; in which Authoritative and Regall power, he ſo reioyceth, that he openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Magiſtrates themſelves to bee ſubiect to his lawes, and that it is not in their power to make Church-lawes, ſo that hee doubts not to accuſe them of tyranny, if they preſume of themſelves to command Church-men, or to queſtion or abrogate Church-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: ſo that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts chiefe drift is, under pretext of legiſlative power, to dominiere over Magiſtrates, and to preſcribe lawes, not onely in Church, but in civill affaires alſo, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to the <hi>Walachrian</hi> ſupercilious ſpiritualities. Many examples of this matter doth the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſhew at <hi>Middleburgh;</hi> whereof ſome I have mentioned already, I will adde one more, of which hee vapours much elſewhere in his patcht book.</p>
               <p>Heretofore the Magiſtrates of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (as they ſay) ordered, that in the Church, Organs ſhould be uſed, for regulating the tunes in ſinging of Pſalmes. This gave occaſion to the <hi>Walachrian</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114151:67"/>the Magiſtrate; and, as they ſay, hee did ſhamefully in his Pulpit, inveigh againſt this order, ſhewing the indignity and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſneſſe thereof, to the people, not without ſcoffs. And becauſe he was not aſhamed to ſet down in this book, the ſumme of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he impudently uſed againſt his own <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe by the way to refell them. Firſt, he ſayth very impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, that <hi>this order is very repugnant to Divine Right, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches practice.</hi> His prime argument is, <hi>That Organs were uſed in the Iewiſh Temple:</hi> whence he concludes, <hi>that hee digges up againe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme, who brings Organs into Chriſtian Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How frivolous this reaſon is, any indifferently learned, may ſee. For I ask, if every thing uſed in the Jewiſh Temple, be unlawfull in Chriſtian worſhip? I ſuppoſe he will not ſay ſo, if he be wiſe: For either there muſt be no Chriſtianity, or God muſt create new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for in the Jewiſh worſhip were not onely Organs, Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals and Tymbrels, but Gold alſo, Silver, Garments, Silk, Wooll, Water, Bread, Wine, and many other things. He ought then to have declared more particularly what was preciſely ceremoniall, and not to be uſed, when we ſee that every thing is not to be reiected.</p>
               <p>He inſtanceth, that Chriſtians ſhould at leaſt omit theſe things, which ſerved for the worſhip of the Jewiſh Temple. For becauſe God deſtroyed that Temple, he gathers by an unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as he calls it) that <hi>what was uſed in the worſhip of that Temple, was aboliſhed, and ſhould be removed from Chriſtian worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here againe he feeds his Reader with toyes: for if we muſt uſe nothing in Chriſtian worſhip, which was ordained for the Jewiſh worſhip, why doth he uſe Churches? In the worſhip of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there were not onely Organs, but the Book of the Law alſo, and Water, Bread, Wine, a Table, an Ark, Seats, Pulpits, Stones, Linnen, &amp;c. Why doth he not alſo deſire the removal of theſe things? The very ſinging of Pſalmes is borrowed from the Jewiſh worſhip,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Hooper.</note> ſayth <hi>Martyr.</hi> Why is not this alſo reiected by the Law-giver <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He inſtanceth, <hi>That Pipes and Organs are dead things, and wind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and as it were Rattles fit for ſuch children and ſtiffe-necked people, as the Iewes; but theſe become not Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> hath ſo little breath, or ſpirit in his Aſſertions, that he produceth nothing that hurts theſe pipes or Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh children. For the queſtion is ſtill the ſame, to wit, if dead animal
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114151:67"/>things uſed by the Jewes in their worſhip, are to bee rejected by Chriſtians in their divine ſervice, why doth hee onely remove Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans? It is to be feared, that if ſuch another <hi>Night-bird</hi> grow as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonius,</hi> that not onely Organs ſhall be taken away, but Books alſo, Tables, Pulpits, Deskes, Garments, and other things. So that this <hi>Walachrian</hi> pratler will bee forced not onely to weary himſelfe in ſtanding, but alſo immodeſtly to wander up and down naked. This petty Law-giver then is too imperious againſt Magiſtrates, who dares break in upon their right ſo raſhly, and Magiſterially declare theſe things unlawfull, which God hath not condemned, but hath left free to Chriſtians. Beſides, the Harmony of Organs is uſefull to hinder the confuſion that many times is in ſinging. The Magiſtrate indeed makes uſe of skilfull finging-men to regulate the tunes of the Pſalmes; but we find by experience, that theſe are not ſufficient to hinder the undecent confuſion in ſinging. Now if the Harmony of Organs be a decent help againſt this ſeandall, who will not ſee that this <hi>Walachrian</hi> is a railing fellow, who ſo injuriouſly rageth againſt Magiſtrates about an order not prohibited, but of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and profit. Surely, he that will but indifferently think, that when there was no publick worſhip, <hi>David</hi> did drive away the evill ſpirit from <hi>Saul,</hi> by his muſick: On the contrary, that <hi>Micha</hi> the Prophet ſtirred up the good ſpirit in himſelfe: He will confeſſe with me, that Chriſtian Minds may be cheered, and modeſtly excited in divine worſhip, as well by the muſick of Organs, as of voyces: So then, by this example we may ſee what wil be the end and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects <hi>of this holy and free legiſlative Church-power,</hi> for which the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> in <hi>Walachria</hi> doth ſo much contend; to wit, that ſome ſpirituall <hi>Night-bird,</hi> out of idleneſſe, and his itching pride, may whilſt he is farting in his ſtudy, conceive the creame of ſome new ſpirituality, and then in his ſuperlatively ſacred Conſiſtorial Affem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, by the Cockes egge of contention, to which preſently the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Toads crawle together, that by cheriſhing and ſitting upon this egge, at laſt the new Baſilisk of Errour and dominiering may be hatched.

               <p>The ſumme of all is this, that now there is no ſpeciall, or any my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall priviledge of ſanctity, in making Church-lawes and ſtatutes, from which pious Magiſtrates are to bee kept off: For either theſe are ordinances of things neceſſary for ſalvation and divine worſhip, all which are contained in Scripture, and are the ancient Lawes of God, not of their modern Church; but who will ſay that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for godly Magiſtrates to make dicrees, and command men to obſerve Chriſts Lawes? Truly, if wicked Magiſtrates would make ſuch Lawes, and enjoyn Curiſtians to keep the pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, they ſhould not be ſacrilegious, but moſt worthy of praiſe: Or elſe the lawes which they make are of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which concerne the order and decency of the Church.

But the old &amp; new Papiſts wil none of this: for ſo they ſhould want much of their ſanctities: whence they pleaſantly talk by way of compariſons: If the Church, that is, the Conſiſtory, ſhould erre; then ſay they, accoording to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, two or three Churches muſt be imployed, and they wil make a Claſſis. Here is a goodly increaſe, for two or three brothers to be enlarged into two or three Churches. This is the Popiſh increaſe, who of one <hi>Peter,</hi> the chiefe Paſtor of the Church, have made innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſucceſſors <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> as it were. But if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that the Claſſis ſhould erre, here the increaſe multiplies: for then two or three Claſſes muſt be imployed, which makes a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Synod; and if this Synod alſo ſhould erre, then the Synods of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Provinces muſt be aſſembled, which make up a general Councel of that Kingdome or State. But if this alſo erre, then the Councels of divers Nations muſt be aſſembled; and ſo there ſhal be a National Councel: &amp; if this ſuffice not, then all the Nations of the world muſt be aſſembled; and ſo wee ſhall have an univerſal or Oecumenical Councell.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114151:69"/>have daſhed his ſpunge againſt the picture, and ſo to have expreſſed it. Even ſo with the ſpunge of ignorance it was needfull to blot out the increaſe of dependency, that hee might find an end of Synods. For at laſt hee concludes, that that is to bee accounted an Occumenicall Councell, to which <hi>if not all the nations of the world come, yet they might have come, becauſe none were excluded.</hi> Though I confeſſe the Jeſuits have found out a ſhorter and certainer way to bound in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency:</hi> For they ſaw that this Synodicall Argument did increaſe <hi>in infinitum;</hi> therefore <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that he might not leave the matter in ſuſpence, at laſt terminates the deciſion of all lawes and queſtions in the Pope, either with or without a Councell; ſo that indeed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is the end of <hi>Roman dependency.</hi> The <hi>Walachrian Dependants</hi> doe execrate an Eccleſiaſtick Pope, but chiefly the Civil; whence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the end of their dependency is either <hi>in infinitum,</hi> or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or many Popes: for if all controverſies muſt be drawn from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a brother, from theſe to a Conſiſtory, from this to a Claſſis, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Claſſis to a Provinciall Synod, from this to a Nationall, from a National to an Univerſall, and this ſtill greater and greater, muſt not then this matter run <hi>in infinitum?</hi> or elſe it will end in this opinion, that he who judgeth laſt, ſhall be thought to judge beſt, whether his judgement be good or bad. What elſe is this, but to make Popes of ſo many Judges? But it is unlikely that ever Chriſt ordained in his Church ſuch a Judicature of controverſies; becauſe it is abſurd, and ſetteth up that domination which Chriſt forbids in his Apoſtles:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.</note> For by theſe meanes, whether it be right or wrong, the greater Synod will command the leſſer; this leſſer, the Claſſis; and this, the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; and the Conſiſtory, the brethren, as it pleaſeth: and ſo by right of this <hi>Dependency,</hi> the whole Church-government will be no order, but Empire, or tyranny: for every inferiour will be forced by blind obedience, to yeeld to his ſuperiour. I call that blind obedience not only when we muſt not enquire of the thing judged, or to be judged, which is the Popes practice; but when ſuch is the government of the Church, that whether you find her error, or not, yet you muſt obey, untill the Church-men ſhall ſay, that they have judged amiſſe, which will never be; I will confidently ſay, that this right of dependency is ſo abſurd, that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> never borrowed from Chriſt, but from Antichriff.</p>
               <p>It is commonly objected out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. where Chriſt himſelfe inſtituted three degrees of dependencies: from one brother to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114151:69"/>from brother to brothers, from brothers to the Church; whence they collect by an argument, <hi>à paribus,</hi> that Chriſt alſo inſtituted the other degrees from the Church to the Claſſis, from this to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, &amp;c. I anſwer, that here a matter of priviledge is handled, and that moſt holy: but in priviledges, words ſhould be very plain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we give any thing to conſequences, or where the law doth not diſtinguiſh, or adde, muſt we adde any thing: whence I gather, that by Chriſts command, men muſt not goe beyond theſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; becauſe he appoynted no more: for Chriſt aſcends no higher then from the three brothers to the Church; which ſhe weth, that Chriſt by the word <hi>Church,</hi> underſtands only a particular Cógregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not Claſſes and Synods, even to the Oecumenical: for it were too great a leap from three brothers, to ſend Chriſtians to the univerſall Councell, if this were meant by the Church. Again, it is not likely, that Chriſt under the name <hi>Church,</hi> doth comprehend Claſſes and Synods; becauſe he there ſpeaks onely of private quarrels to be taken up between brothers, of which there is no need of meetings of Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Synods, even to the Oecumenical; for then every day theſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods ſhould be aſſembled, becauſe ſuch controverfies may ariſe daily; and if they did not ariſe, the <hi>Walachrian Dependants</hi> would daily ſtir them up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Dependency</hi> they alledge theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I will be in the midſt of them.</hi> But what they collect hence is of no validity. For firſt it is known, that all Conſiſtories are not gathered together in Chriſts name, nor Claſſes, nor Councels; but oftentimes two or three may be together reverently, and in the feare of God, when on the contrary, a Claſſick, or Synodicall Aſſembly may caſt of all reverence of Chriſt. So we ſee that when the two Diſciples were to going <hi>Emmaus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 24.</note> Chriſt was in the midſt of them, when as he hath not been preſent in greater Aſſemblies, where contention hath been. Therefore I ſay ſecondly, that this conſequence is weak; becauſe Chriſt promiſeth that he will be preſent to two or three, therefore he wil be much more preſent to ten, a hundred, or a thouſand. But thus the <hi>Walachrian,</hi> after the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits manner, doth in a manner conclude; but in this he is unſavoury, as if he ſhould argue, that becauſe Chriſt ſaid there ſhould bee peace and concord between two or three, therefore there ſhould be much more concord between ten, or a hundred: for as peace and order is not ſo eaſily kept in great meetings, as in ſmaller; ſo there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114151:70"/>to think, that truth, or the deciſion thereof, ſhould be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly found in great then in ſmall aſſemblies. Not onely hath <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> but alſo all times have taught, that matters are not alwayes better judged in greater Church-meetings, then in leſſer; ſo that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily either Chriſt performeth not his promiſe (which is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) or elſe the new Papiſts miſunderſtand Chriſts promiſe &amp; think fooliſhly when they conclude a priviledge of ſo great and exact ſm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32.</note> out of a promiſe not rightly underſtood.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Paul</hi> ſeem to be plainer, <hi>The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> Whence they gather the divine right of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Conſiſtories, Claſſes and Synods. For how ſhall it appeare better, that the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, then when the ordinary Church-prophets are ſubject to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorial, and theſe to the Claſſick Prophets, the Claſſick to the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and ſo a greater Prophet muſt command the leſſer ſubject to him? Theſe are the <hi>Enthymems</hi> of old Papiſts, with which the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> doth exactly correſpond for poliſhing the right of his <hi>Dependency.</hi> I anſwer, that he makes a Mountain of a Mole-hill, who wil wreſt all this out of <hi>Pauls</hi> words: for this is not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the fewer Prophets ſhould alway ſubſcribe to the vote of the greater number: this were a rotten paradox, which brought in Antichriſt; becauſe we find many times, that the opinion of one lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath been ſounder then of many Clergy-men. Neither wil this follow out of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, that the Prophets of leſſer authority ſhould be alwayes ſubject and obedient to thoſe of greater authority. This were true indeed, if there were preſent one that were divinely inſpired, he truly were to be preferred before a thouſand others, and all others not divinely inſpired, were to ſubmit to him. But whereas divine inſpiration is ceaſed, no ſuch ſuperiority or preheminence muſt be placed in any one, to which abſolutely other Prophets muſt be ſubject. For howſoever the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> prates, with the Papiſts, of the abundant aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, which lay-men ought to hope are in their Leaders and Paſtors, when they meet together in the Conſiſtory, Claſſis, or Synod, that ſo hee may procure to himſelfe blind obedience: yet this is certain, that there is no ſuch promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which ſhall continue for ever. And all ages teach us, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dangerous aad moſt hurtful poyſon hath proceeded from them that excell in number and authority; as may be ſeen in the riſing and progreſſe of Antichriſtianiſme: So that doubtleſſe there is another
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114151:70"/>meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, then this Popiſh one: For he ſpeakes of the government of the Church of his time,

At this day <hi>the Miniſter alone doth all,</hi> and takes upon him whatſoever is judiciall; that hee alone may preach with authority; as for other Church. Prophets, they like women muſt hold their peace in the congregation; neither doe they doubt, but he ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed in <hi>Walachria,</hi> who though a Prophet, ſhould take upon him either privatly or publickly, to reprove <hi>Apelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for his errours and lies, though he deſerve it if he were not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Magiſtrate: So that the whole marrow of modern <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> chiefly of the <hi>Walachrian,</hi> obttude upon Chriſtians (every one of which is now a Prophet) what they pleaſe; and if perhaps hee ſhall be found in an errour, then to betake himſelf to the Conſiſtorials, ſuch Prophets as himſelf, then to the Claſſiairies, (as we ſee in this work) at laſt to Synods; of all which if the greater part ſhould be mad with the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> all other Prophets muſt be forced, whether it be right or wrong, to ſubmit to theſe mad men. It was farre otherwiſe among the Apoſtles, as <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in this place; every one performed his own part: ſome did ſpeake with tongues, others did interpret, others did rule the Church as Governours and Captaines, others gave almes,
<note place="margin">

Yet becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all ſpiritual gifts, excelling all others in Apoſtolical digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt the Church ſhould imploy too many Prophets without order, he preſcribes theſe lawes, that by turn every one ſhould utter his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and revelations, whilſt others hold their peace. And left the people ſhould be wearied with too long exerciſe, that they ſhould not propheſie above three at a time: laſtly, that they doe not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtrife and quarrelling, For they propheſied by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt alone, they ſhould never utter contrariety, though they ſpake divers things, and in a different way and degree of revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as might be ſeen in the Prophets of old; an example of this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in two famous Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> this propheſied at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſhould
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114151:71"/>be carried captive into <hi>Babylon:</hi> the other being captive in <hi>Babylon,</hi> foretold that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhould be taken, and that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſhould not ſee the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Theſe two propheſies did ſeem to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory; but yet by experience both were found true: for <hi>Zedekiah</hi> came captive to <hi>Babylm,</hi> as <hi>Ieremie</hi> propheſied, and yet did not ſee it, as <hi>Ezekiel-foretold;</hi> becauſe the King of <hi>Babel</hi> had put out his eyes before he was carried away. So it fell out among the Apoſtles, that though they preacheddivers things, and in a divers way, yet they all uttered the ſame thing. Thus then it was alwayes true, what the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> ſo long as they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being inſpired by the holy Ghoſt: For it is impoſſible that they ſhould not agree among themſelves; but as ſoon as the falſe Apoſtles did mingle themſelves with thoſe who were divinely inſpired, and when with them began to quarrel <hi>Alexander the Copper-Smith, Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> &amp; <hi>Diotrephes, ſpeaking evil words,</hi> then it was no wonder if diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did ariſe among them, and that the ſpirit of the true Prophets did never ſubmit themſelves to falſe Prophets. If theſe things fall out then, when men divinely inſpired were preſent; how much more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it, that ſome <hi>Walachrian</hi> babling fellows ſhould at this day meet together, and think that by right of dependency, the ſpirits of all men muſt be ſubject to them?</p>

               <p>For the perſwading of the holineſſe of dependency, they aſcribe much to the inſtitution of the Jewes; whom they ſay had leſſer aſſemblies in each citie, all which depended from the general aſſembly at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe the old Papiſts have borrowed this (as many things elſe) from the Jewiſh Common-wealth, that the holy Clergy might have among themſelves a dependency and ſubordination, ſo that at laſt all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114151:71"/>depend from the Pope, as from a rotten threed. But becauſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was tied to the ceremoniall ſanctity of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the holy Citie and Temple, which long ſince is deſtroyed, I wonder the <hi>Stile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walker</hi> doth not call to mind how diſgracefull a thing it is to <hi>dig up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again Indaiſme.</hi> For by this irrefragable argument, he did upbraid his own Magiſtrates with Judalſme, and the rattles of carnall Jewes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they onely made uſe of Organs, uſed among the Jewes, to rectifie the tunes in Pſalmes, whereas he borrowes not onely from the Jewes, but from the Papiſts alſo, the whole myſtery of dependency and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as a thing moſt ſacred; although this alſo was in the Jewiſh dependency (as I will ſhew elſewhere) that Magiſtrates were preſent by divine right in all Judicatures: and thus hath he overthrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But the main ground of dependency is taken from the cuſtome of the Apoſtles; they had often Church-meetings, and (if Magiſtrates will beleeve it) they had a Councell at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> which therefore by the old and new Papiſts is called, <hi>the firſt Councell of Ieruſalem.</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is of ſuch moment with <hi>Apolonius,</hi> that he acounts him ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, that will dare to hiſſe againſt it: whence he concludes, that it is of divine, ſacred, and Apoſtolicall right for Church-men to meet in Conſiſtories, Claſſes, and Synods; and therefore that it is Simoniacal, wicked, and tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For they did many things upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which we neither can nor ought now to imitate. For example, rich men brought their goods, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet; which goods the Apoſtles diſtributed: of which care afterwards the Apoſtles freed themſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> went up to Jeruſalem to ſee and to ſalute <hi>Peter;</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114151:72"/>There is no need now. However the Magiſtrate with him is worldly and carnall, by reaſon of which he is unable to touch ſpirituall Church-affaires; for they are of a heavenly extraction, and as it were <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> quinteſſence; yet he doth well in heaping ſtipends upon Church-men: yet the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> with his fellowes, plainly threaten, that unleſſe they will keep off their ſacrilegious lands from their ſpiritualities, that they will one time or other ſtrip the Magiſtrate of their bountifull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: nor is it hard for them to draw this right alſo out of their divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if Magiſtrates will beleeve their devices and trickes. For as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Walachrian</hi> divinity hath ratified that Magiſtrates have no right to be preſent or preſident in their Conſiſtories, Claſſes, or Synods, by reaſon of the holy <hi>Dependencie,</hi> or have any power to gather or diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the almes, be cauſe of the holineſſe of <hi>Deaconſhip:</hi> even ſo they have no right to meddle with the revenues and ſtipends of Miniſters, by that Apoſtolicall law: <hi>The mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn, muſt not be muzled:</hi> And, <hi>he who ſerves at the Altar muſt live by the Altar.</hi> By which Title the Pope now a long time hath challenged to himſelfe this holineſſe; but it is to be feared, that if the Magiſtrates out of their negligence, will yeeld to the new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſts, and chiefly to the <hi>Apolonians,</hi> this part alſo of ſpirituality, leſt a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake ariſing out of this exhalation, miſerably ſhake and overthrow both the Cities of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and of the united Provinces, and alſo deſtroy and overwhelm the Magiſtrate in this ruine. But this by the way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Major of the Argument.</p>
               <p>I anſwer then firſt, it is uſuall with the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> to blabbe out many things without judgement, concerning the Apoſtolicall cuſtome of teaching, cenſuring, and governing, which at this day belong no more to the Papall modern Hierarchy, then heretofore <hi>Hercules</hi> his ſhooes to a child. For the cuſtome of the Apoſtles both in dignity and manner of meeting in the Church, is infinitly different from our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Aſſemblies. Secondly, I know the ancients doe much extoll that meeting of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> therefore they call it a Councell, which the new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt borrowes from him: and I deny not but thoſe firſt Church-worthies did excellent things in ſetling of the Church: But I cannot be induced to beleeve, that it was a Synod, or that it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt things requiſite for a Claſſis, if they be examined according to the pomp of modern dependency and things required for a Synod, which will appeare by the circumſtances added by <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth nothing of calling this Synod, concerning the right of which our Dependants do ſo much ſtrive; the Text intimates, that they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114151:72"/>met onely occaſionally: ſome Judaizing brethren came from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Aatioch,</hi> where they troubled the Church, ſaying, that <hi>Paul</hi> differed in doctrine from the Apoſtles at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> That the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> might prevent this evill, appointed that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with a few that might accompany them, ſhould go up to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> neither doe I find any where, that an order was ſent to thoſe of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that on ſuch a day, in ſuch a place, they ſhould prepare themſelves for a Synod, which neceſſarily muſt have been done at this day: if a day had been appoynted for this Synod, would <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo's</hi> going thither, have travelled over <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> (as <hi>Luke</hi> records) which was in a manner to goe out of the way? Their comming alſo is ſo deſcribed, that it was acceptable to the Church of <hi>Iernſalem,</hi> but yet unlooked for, as may be conjectured. Beſides, <hi>Luke</hi> records no where that the Legates of divers Churches and Synods came to this meeting, which muſt have been, had this been a Synod. I confeſſe, the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> would fain perſwade this to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that the Deputies of divers Churches did meet in this Synod: But in this hee ſhewes his falſhood, and how he participates of that lying ſpirit, by which God would have Kings to be deceived. But that he may not here coſen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> I fore-warn them, that he in this lieth, and cheateth them divers wayes. He cites the 26. and 23. verſes of that chap:
<note place="margin">Act 15.</note> but he who wil read all things attentively, ſhal find, that <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Deputies of divers Churches, as <hi>Apolonius</hi> feignes. But chiefly obſerve his errour in alledging to prove this matter, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.16. where it is recorded, that with <hi>Paul</hi> going up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> there joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves <hi>ſome Diſciples, bringing with them one Mnaſon of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, with whom the Church had lodged;</hi> but not a word of the Deputies of divers Churches; and if any thing be found like this; it is too much impudencie and ſtupidity to confound this going up with that <hi>Acts</hi> 15. For there is many yeares difference; for this was almoſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Pauls</hi> Apoſtleſhip; but that in the end, becauſe ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Paul</hi> was taken, and carrid to <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that <hi>Davus</hi> here hath not well divided his times, which is ſo much the leſſe to be indured in one ſo proudly puffed up, who is ſo luxuriant in urging his own Embaſſie, his authority in preaching, and his inſeparable ſubordination to Chriſt: So that there is nothing more likely, then that this <hi>Walacheian</hi> doth belch every day out of the Pulpit in <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> many abſurdities and lies by authority, who durſt obtrude to the learned <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both in writing and print, ſuch manifeſt falſhoods. Now that we may further ſearch out in this ſacred Aſſembly, the pomp of a Synod, we muſt ſee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114151:73"/>if we can find in <hi>Luke</hi> any thing <hi>of Order, of Seſſions, of letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of the choyce of a Moderator, of the right of deciſion,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things required in a Synod; which the Pope hath finely painted out; of whoſe fetches this our Pope is not a little proud, ſo that hee bewitches the Magiſtrate with the ſanctity of his <hi>Dependency.</hi> Surely <hi>Luke</hi> makes no mention of theſe toyes, which pride afterwards found out: but on the contrary, we ſee that the whole people were preſent at this Aſſembly. For it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.4. <hi>that Paul and his company were received by the Church, the Apoſtles and Presbyters:</hi> Neither were they there onely to <hi>conſult,</hi> but alſo <hi>to decide and to determine.</hi> For it is ſayd, <hi>v.</hi> 22. It ſeemes good to the Apoſtles, Presbyters, with the whole Church. Neither is there any ſigne that matters were carried by votes, neither was there any diſpute about the Moderatorſhip. There were ſo many Apoſtles, and pillars of the Church preſent, yet no man impaired the others authority, as if there had been need of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to be there with his Scepter, &amp; of the Pope with his Croſier ſtaff, but every one ſpake as occaſion ſerved, ſometimes <hi>Peter,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Paul,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Iames,</hi> others being ſilent: for all without law, or command, abſtained from confuſion and tumults; ſo that when one ſpake, the other held their peace. None therefore of the Apoſtles did aſſume to himſelfe any Judiciall power or prerogative, ſuch as is brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of at this day.</p>
               <p>Now if we look upon the event of the Councel, there is nothing that favoureth of any pomp or Synodicall pride, ſuch as is at this day: they concluded not proudly, as the Pope doth, but thus, <hi>it ſeemes good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us.</hi> Nor did they impoſe their ordinances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Nations; but onely upon the Churches of <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> which had imployed their help and Councel. They were ſo moderate in commanding, that they rather perſwaded then commanded: for in a familiar letter they wrot to them even concerning the piety of their Legats, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> praying rather obedience from them, then requiring it; which they needed not have done, if they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the Pope, or the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> to command with authority. Laſtly, the lawes which they made, were of things indifferent, which they did not urge ſo rigidly, as not to leave it free for any to doe as they thought good, when occaſion ſerved, as afterwards we know the <hi>Galatians, Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did violate theſe lawes, when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This then is that holy Synod! this is that firſt councell of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of which both old and new Papiſts doe ſo much bragge; in which if

Whether they are to have a ſentence definitive, or deliberative? whether Church-ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may become Church-lawes? whether they bind the conſcience directly or indirectly? Whether they oblige by a coactive ſpirituall power?</hi> and innumerable other things which hee hath gathered out of the Popes Danghill for Jewels, and with them hath ſtuffed his work. Truly, if he can draw theſe things out of this Apoſtolicall meeting, hee will deſerve to be made of a poore <hi>Walachrian</hi> Shepheard, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or a <hi>German</hi> Superintendent. I can ſcarce think that this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was a Claſſis, in reſpect of outward things, and not much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be accounted, then if the Church of <hi>Snecana,</hi> or <hi>Doccoma,</hi> ſhould in a different caſe conſult with the <hi>Francian</hi> or <hi>Leowardian</hi> Church, and ſhould ſend two or three of their Church, and receive from that Church, a writing concerning things indifferent.</p>
               <p>They commonly anſwer, that all the Apoſtles were preſent, which gave to this meeting the honour of a generall Councell. I confeſſe, that the authority of this Councell was ſo great, that it exceeded all the Councels of the whole world; and if at this day there were a councel, in which ſo many, yea, if there were but one divinely inſpired, his authority ſhould bee of greater account with mee, then of all the wiſe men in the world: But becauſe it is diſputed whether this was ſuch a Synod, as the Dependents at this day deſcribe, they are no leſſe fooliſh that perſwade this, then if they ſhould prove the Popes proud Scarlet Robe out of <hi>Peters</hi> Fiſhermans garment. Truly, if all the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in which CHRIST and his Apoſtles were preſent, are to be accounted Councels, there were many Councels in the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>But they ſay more, that this meeting did impoſe lawes upon the whole Church, and therefore muſt be held for a Councell but this is falſe, as I ſhewed before. For if every meeting which ordaines and decrees ſuch things as may be uſefull for many Churches, bee a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, then ſure many Confiſtories are to be held for Councels.</p>

But I would not have men think, with theſe new Papiſts, that there is ſuch neceſſity in this worke, as if Gods worſhip could not ſubſiſt without it, or that there is ſuch an inward ſanctity in it, that pious Magiſtrates muſt not meddle therewith. It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected, that civill Magiſtrates could not be preſent at Eccleſiaſtick meetings; becauſe in the Apoſtles times there were none ſuch among Chriſtians: but beſides that this is doubtfull, this is at leaſt certaine, that the Apoſtles did ſo govern the Church, that they admitted the whole body in managing Church-affaires; which becauſe it conſiſted of many Lay-men, it is apparent they were not ſo preciſe as to think any man unworthy becauſe of his ſecular calling, or unfit to manage all Church-buſineſſe, as I will hereafter ſhew more at large.</p>
               <p>But let pious Magiſtrates know, that of old under Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the coactive and principall power of the Church reſided mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly in thoſe governours: and becauſe this miraculous power is now ceaſed in the Church-rulers, and reſideth ordinarily in pious Princes, that it is their part to be chiefe, and to be Preſidents in all Church-Aſſemblies: not as if they were to doe what they pleaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, which is the direct practice of the old Papiſts, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intended by the new, under the vizard of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But that being furniſhed with the gifts of piety and prudence, they may be at this day, the Churches <hi>Eyes, Eares, and Hands,</hi> and may every way benefit her; chiefly in ſuch places where the <hi>Apoloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that can turn themſelves into all ſhapes, hunt after command and worldly honour, and by their ſeditious pens and tongues, teach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be ſawcy and rebellious to pious Secular governours; whom if they keep under, according to their juſt and divine authority, they will caſe Chriſtians of many inconveniences, and ſhall exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeakes of many other things which belong to the Miniſtery, which are, <hi>To aſſiſt the poore with their prayers and comforts, to help poore widowes with their counſell, and with ſuch things as they want, to viſit the ſick; and to cure them if they can.</hi> Theſe works God exceedingly commends; but becauſe they are ſervile therefore <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> leaves them for holy Lay-men, whom commonly they call <hi>Viſiters of the ſick:</hi> he reſerves for himſelfe whatſoever hath in it ſuperlative ſpirituality and juriſdiction, to which he hath lately transferred the right of collecting and diſtributing almes to the uſe of the poore. For although hitherto all good men have thought it a benefit that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114151:76"/>have out of their own purſes helped the poore members of the Church, and taken care for them: Yet the <hi>Stils-walker</hi> by his ſeraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call acute wit, finding out ſome inconveniences that may redound to him and his colleagues, if this power ſhould be in the Magiſtrate, he ſharply contends for this holy priviledge, as being a part of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Juriſdiction; and therefore is ſayd publickly in writing to have in an imperious way ſignified to his Magiſtrates, that they have no right to collect and diſtribute; and that it is unlawfull for them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to thruſt their prophane Secular ſickle into this ſacred corn. He is ſayd alſo to become ſo untoward, that with his <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſiaries he hath forbid the Deacons of all the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Churches, that they ſhould upon any order from the Magiſtrate, gather almes for the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> I confeſſe that I cannot, being ſo far off, fiſh out every thing exactly: yet becauſe the rumor of this Paradox, and ſumme of his reaſons are come hither to us; ſuch ridiculous delight there is in this inquiſition, that although I make haſte, yet I cannot but a little touch upon theſe trifling conceits which he hath divulged.</p>
               <p>He doth not think almes in it ſelfe to be properly holy; that is, the gift exhibited by Chriſtians, which in Scripture is called properly, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſacrifice: For he ſeeth this to be common to all Lay-men, and of the <hi>Dative caſe;</hi> which caſe the Pope exceedingly abhors: For <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> feignes that he is poore, and that he hath nothing but what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him by Chriſtians for the uſe of the poore. Whence one ſayd of old, not unpleaſantly, that the Pope was <hi>a Participle, &amp; of the Ablative caſe.</hi> From whence doubtleſſe the <hi>Stilt-Walker</hi> learned, (as he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) to contend for the ſpirituality of almes, not that he exceeds <hi>in giving,</hi> but onely in receiving, and in the right of diſtributing that which is none of his, the quality whereof I wil briefly diſcuſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in a juggling way he ſuppoſeth, that the ſanctity of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes</hi> doth wonderfully exceed that of Lay-mens: ſo that theſe are prophane and worldly, not appertaining properly to Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but the others are moſt holy. Whence hee concludes, that they are to be handled onely by <hi>holy men,</hi> that is, Church-men, and not Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Now he placeth the ground of ſanctity of theſe Church-almes, in this, that they are given by the holy or faithfull men of the Church, and for the uſe of holy men in another Church, that is, of the faithfull; ſo that here ariſeth a heavenly ſanctity of Church-almes, from the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus à quo;</hi> to wit, the <hi>faithfull givers;</hi> and from the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> to wit, the <hi>faithfull receivers:</hi> whence neceſſarily muſt proceed the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the <hi>terminus per quem,</hi> to wit, that this holy thing muſt not be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114151:77"/>medled with, but by holy men. Now ordinary ſanctity wil not ſuffice for this, ſuch as is found in all believers, and therefore in pious Magiſtrates, although this be accounted moſt holy in Scripture; yet ſuch is the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> Philoſophy, that he reckoneth this for none, or at leaſt only for a <hi>privative</hi> ſanctity, which is unfit to handle thoſe holy almes: but he admits here onely Eccleſiaſtick or <hi>poſitive</hi> ſanctity of Deacons, or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> of Elders; or at laſt, <hi>ſuperlative.</hi> This is the whole Eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynary dreame, which the <hi>Walachrian</hi> dreamed in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or in the Popes Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> I will not ſpend much time in diſpelling theſe ſmoakes; yet I will ſhew the abſurdity of this foolery, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men may laugh at it.</p>
               <p>For I ask, if the civill Magiſtrate doe beſtow as much money for the uſe of the poore, as the Church can beſtow; whether this mony ſhall be holier, if it come out of the Churches treaſure, then if out of the Magiſtrates? If he denies this, then the fiction of Church-monies ſanctity will faile. If he affirmes it, then it will neceſſarily follow, that in the Churches treaſure there lurketh ſome myſtery of holines, which can make that the ſame money which is given by Lay men, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but by the Church, ſacred and holy, which is a meere Jewiſh and Popiſh fiction.</p>
               <p>Again, if the ſanctity of Church-money ariſeth from the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> that is, of the faithfull giver, then neceſſarily it ceaſeth, if he be not holy who gives it: Whence <hi>Apolonius</hi> and his Deacons muſt be very carefull, that nothing come into their treaſure that is not holy; ſo that they muſt ask of every one that giveth, who art thou? Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or unfaithfull? So that it is then impoſſible to keep this ſanctity within bounds, but it will break through: for not onely holy faithfull men do give almes in the Church, but Lay-men alſo; yea, wicked men, and enemies to the Church; whence one of theſe muſt follow, to wit, that either the ſanctity of Church-almes is altogether prophaned, by a mixture of unhallowed money, or at leaſt that this ſanctity conſiſteth not of the pure flower or duſt of ſpirituality, becauſe there is mingled with it much Bran and Huskes of infidelity.</p>
               <p>I ask again, if a great part of the Church-money be given by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, (as oftentimes) how can the holy money ſanctifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane? For wee will yeeld this to <hi>Apolonius</hi> his ſtrong faith, that Church-money is much more powerfull in ſanctifying, then Lay-mens money in prophaning: but that hee may not with Chymiſts make this power infinite, hee muſt neceſſarily define how much prophane money can that holy Church-money ſanctifie? to wit,

Surely, if the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Church-money be ſo fruitfull, he did in vain contend with his Magiſtrate about receiving of almes from the Deacons in the Church, and not from Lay-men with the Deacons from doore to doore. For though it is to be feared, leſt while they gather, ſome thing may be given by the unfaithful; yet it is certain that a great part of the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes from the faithfull, from houſe to houſe, that we muſt hope, that a few pence gathered from the holy members of the Church, will eaſily ſanctifie the profane, although there had been ten times more; ſo that the <hi>Stil-Walker</hi> may now ſee he was too ſollicitous for his <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus à quo</hi> of his Eleemoſynary ſanctity: the Apoſtles were not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in receiving of aimes; for whether they were offered by holy <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> or by <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> hypocrites, they received the gift, and imployed it to ſome holy uſe. Sure this <hi>Apolonius</hi> is more ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then the Pope his predeceſſor, who findes the ſmell of gain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant out of any thing: whence this is one of his maximes: <hi>Let no man ask whence he had it, but have it he muſt.</hi> The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is ſo delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy, that he had rather want, and ſuffer holy poore Chriſtians to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, then that they ſhould receive any thing from godly Lay-men, or by them, as being prophane. Here then we ſee, that there is nothing ſo ſacred and holy with theſe <hi>Walachriant;</hi> to which they preferre not the holineſſe of their Hierarchy: for if the godly Magiſtrate be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to gather and diſtribute almes, then they ſuppoſe that their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is gelded, the chiefeſt ſinew whereof they know conſiſts in this, that under ſhew of ſanctity they impoſe a tax upon Chriſtians, as their ſubjects; whoſe money ſo ſcraped together, if Church-men have alſo right to diſtribute, by reaſon of the ſame Eleemoſynary ſanctity, who ſeeth not but theſe men will in a ſhort time get the holy treaſure to themſelves; and if they think good at any time to ſhake off the yoak of Lay-Magiſtrates, not onely doe they with their railing tongues ſtirre up the people againſt their Princes (as now they doe) but arme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

If he will preferre <hi>Judas,</hi> a Thiefe, a Traytor, a Divell, in ſanctity to the pious Magiſtrate, the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> for me may enjoy his owne paradox.</p>
               <p>He ſpends much time in commending the example of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church, in which Almes were handled onely by Eccleſiaſtick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as Deacons, and no wayes by Lay-men, who then were no part of the Church, but her enemies; this he cries out is to be held for an inviolable and perpetuall law.</p>
               <p>But I have ſhewed already, that in this <hi>Apolonius</hi> playes the foole:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114151:79"/>for the Apoſtles did not any thing concerning the circumſtances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, which were changed in proceſſe of time; yea, they themſelves did change them: otherwiſe let him tell me, why firſt did Chriſtians bring their goods, and lay them at the Apoſtles feet, and afterwards this cuſtome was aboliſhed? Why at firſt had the Apoſtles care of the poore, and charge of the Tables, and afterwards eaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this care? Why againe, as occaſion ſerved, did they take this care upon them? Why were Biſhops of old, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the collections of the church &amp; afterwards ſtipends were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Lay-men, as now it is? Do Chriſtians at this day violate <hi>Pauls</hi> precept,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3.</note> whilſt they goe to law one with another about worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, which he forbad the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> grievouſly reproving them? Cuſtome and time can change many things in the circumſtances of worſhip, for main cauſes without offence. If we beleeve <hi>Apolonius,</hi> Lay-men were not admitted into the Church under the Apoſtles: if this be perpetuall, why are they not now kept out? Who ſeeth not a plain cauſe of this change? Of old they were not admitted within the Church, becauſe they were enemies and wolves; after wards they were admitted, becauſe they became friends, keepers, and nurſing Fathers of the Church. The like muſt we ſay of Almes, the Apoſtles did not demand them of any without the Church; the reaſon, becauſe they were enemies they would not take them: Now becauſe they may without controlment give, and as faithfull members of the Church will give them, why ſhould their bounty be rejected:</p>
               <p>But (ſaith he) <hi>this is Arminianiſme, and ſo all the offices of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, may to the ruine of religion, be transferred upon Lay-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As though (forſooth) <hi>Arminius</hi> deſired the ruine of religion, who however he had his errors, yet in this he was the friend of Religion, becauſe he was a ſtout enemy againſt the Pope. For he (if ever there was any in the world) is the over-thrower of Chriſts worſhip and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Now whereas the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> doth in every thing imitate him, he hath alſo borrowed from him, this whoriſh impudencie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon another the ruine of Religion, which hee himſelfe, by all the meanes hee can, endevoureth to overthrow. But in this hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his old maſters the Phariſees, in caſting odious names upon the truth, as they injuriouſly called Chriſt a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a <hi>Carpenter.</hi> Surely Religion ſhould not be ruined, if godly Magiſtrates at this day, being furniſhed with faith, and ſpirituall gifts, ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and help all the Offices of the Church, in which I have ſhewed there is no ſpeciall ſanctity now, which ſhould cauſe them to forbeare,

I confeſſe they are ſacred in reſpect of the <hi>Author,</hi> God, and of the <hi>End,</hi> Gods worſhip; but this onely is a generall ſanctity, ſuch as is in reading, praying, and ſinging Pſalmes, which are lawfull for all Chriſtians, if they be apt to perform them. Nor will I deny, but that under the Apoſtles they were exceedingly holy in reſpect of the manner, becauſe they were ordained with gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch as infallible Truth, notable Piety, and power of miracles, in which thoſe great Maſter-builders of the Church excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: hence at that time thoſe Church-buſineſſes did almoſt exceed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacity; which gifts albeit they have long ſince ceaſed in the Church, yet the old Papiſts will not give off to meaſure their Church-buſineſſe and vizzard of their Miniſtery at this day out of that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe footſteps the <hi>Walachrian</hi> company of new Papiſts follow, which prate of ſuch wonders of the ſublime ſpirituality of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe which they daily performe, that they would perſwade us, that no Lay-man, or vulgar Chriſtian, eſpecially a Magiſtrate, can attaine to the ſpirituality thereof: which how frivolous it is, may appeare out of the Eccleſiaſtick functions, being ſeverally examined, the exerciſe of which is not of ſuch difficulty, but every common man in the Church may eaſily performe: or if there be any thing of more eminency, ſuch as preaching is thought be at this day, that alſo is acquired by humane Arts, as mechanicall trades are; ſo that he is thought to excell moſt in this, who hath beſt learned <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Metaphyſicks, <hi>Quintilians</hi> Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or the acting of Stage-Players: If the ſanctity of Church-buſineſſe flowes from theſe fountains, it is no wonder if it ſeldome produce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects truly holy and ſpirituall in its actors and workmen, but rather ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of the fleſh, whence they came, then of the ſpirit; ſo that there is nothing more ordinary, then for the flower it ſelf of Church-ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to fall with ſuch eaſe into errors, ſtrifes, pride and luxury, that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Ordinaria.</note> Hence were begot thoſe ordinary rules of calling, by which care was taken, that none but fit men were admitted into Eccleſiaſtick Functions, and all occaſions of precedency or dominion were cut off: againſt which miſchief, the chief and firſt builders of the Church could find no better remedy, then that Miniſters ſhould be called by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approbation of the whole Church, in which we ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wonderfull moderation and ſpirituall modeſty; for ſuch was their dignity in the Church, and exuberance of all ſpirituall gifts, that they could eaſily, by reaſon of their authority and infallible judgement, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and ſend abroad Governours, to whom people might have ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted themſelves, without the ſuffrages of the inferiour ſort, and ſuch as were not divinely inſpired: but yet, becauſe they had the ſpirit of modeſty, they took not upon them this prerogative, nor did they account that vocation ratified, except it had been performed by impoſition of hands, votes, lots, faſtings, prayers, and by the concourſe and conſent of all the members of the Church. This is ſo pregnant an example of modeſty &amp; popular government in that moſt happy age of the Church,

               <p>And this was the more to be admired, when the complement and confirmation of callings was performed by <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome being borrowed from the ancient Jewes: For though Elders, and perhaps all, could promiſcuouſly lay on hands, yet it was known, that then great vertues did ariſe from the impoſition of the Apoſtles hands, which vertues were preſently ſeen in him on whom their hands were laid: For, on them Chriſt had powred out ſuch a plentifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Spirit, that their <hi>garments, handkerchiefs;</hi> yea the Apoſtles <hi>ſhadowes</hi> healed the ſick, their impoſition of hands then could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114151:82"/>which was then ſo manifeſt to all, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> being moved at the novelty of this thing, endeavoured for a ſum of money to buy this gift of impoſing hands of <hi>Peter.</hi> Nor need we doubt, but that this vertue by little and little decreaſed, till at laſt it quite failed: ſo that queſtionleſſe the Apoſtles impoſition of hands was moſt ſacred, ſeeing it never erred, and alwayes manifeſted its effects: but in others it fell out ſomtimes, that it failed both in the choice and effects; ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then <hi>Paul</hi> warned <hi>Timothie,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> that he lay not hands ſuddenly on any man.</hi> It's no wonder then, if this ſimplicity of miſſion and vocation, with the concourſe of ſo many ſpirituall gifts, did give unto men ſome divine ſanctity, which preſently ſhewed it ſelfe by its effects, that I may ſpeak freely, if there be now in the world ſuch a <hi>caller,</hi> or any called by ſuch a <hi>calling,</hi> the reſpect of ſpirituality is to be given to him, above all majeſties whatſoever. But now we may deplore the unhappineſſe of our times, and the pride of Clergy-men, who though they are deſtitute of the badges of true divine calling, and of ſpirituall gifts, yet are ſo highly conceited of the prerogatives of their calling, that the Prophets and Apoſtles were much more numble. This is an old errour among the ancient Papiſts, that as ſoon as one is made a Ruler of the Church by Eccleſiaſtick vocation, he is no leſſe proud then if he had come downe from heaven, endowed with excellency above all other men: for they ſay, that the vocation and conſecration of the Church <hi>imprints an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible character, not onely on the body, but alſo on the ſoule of the Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> which is obſerved by <hi>Martyr.</hi>

               <p>I deny not the ſanctity and efficacy of this ceremony in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but he that will ſearch for the ſame ſanctity and efficacy at this day, in imitating of this Ceremony, whileſt the <hi>Stilt-Walker</hi> layeth on his hands polluted in the ſinke of all wickedneſſe, he may as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that becauſe Chriſt (by applying clay to the blind-mans eyes) reſtored him to his ſight, and by breathing on the Apoſtles, ſent them abroad to preach, that therefore there will be the ſame efficacy, if ſome <hi>Jugler</hi> ſhould imitate Chriſt in laying clay upon a blind mans eyes, or the Pope in Conſecration ſhould belch out the ſtinking vapours of his ſurfetting ſtomack.</p>

The <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deſtitute of Church-Sanctity in all their Church-trimming, but they rather exceeded other in this point; they ſay alſo, that in this principall ſanctity of calling, if a Miniſter is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from one Church to another, hee is carefull to ſeeke out a ſucceſſor that hath a good eſtate, or a full purſe, that if hee chance to leave there behind him land, or a handſome houſe, hee may ſell theſe at a deerer rate to his ſucceſſor; and if the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine go on, he on the other ſide promiſeth to faſten upon him that Church his ancient Spouſe, of which hee is now weary, nor will hee give over till by hook or by crook hee hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his deſire; for this ſeems to bee moſt eſſentiall, that the Conſiſtorie ſhould have power to chooſe a new father for the Infant the Church: and becauſe the Sanctity of the Conſiſtory hath divers degrees, that of the Deacons is poſitive, of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders comparative onely, it is moſt fit that the whole right of calling be left to the ſuperlative ſanctity of the Miniſter, whoſe ſpirituall intent is oftentimes not the edification of the Church, but the price of their own wares.

               <p>I know that ſomtimes things are carried more conſcionably, and that the abuſe of a thing takes not ſtill away the uſe thereof; yet this I dare ſay, that becauſe at this day are wanting men divinely inſpired to call, and becauſe the beſtowing of ſpirituall gifts is ſeparate at this day from Impoſition of hands, though it be done by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and for a ſpirituall end, yet in reſpect of the manner, modern vocation is meerly humane, becauſe the whole manner is fallible, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and oftentimes corrupted; whence the effects muſt be alſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and oftentimes moſt vitious: ſo that we have inſtead of <hi>Apollo Apollonius,</hi> a Sophiſter for a Prophet, a Sycophant for a Biſhop: But becauſe this vocation is with <hi>Apollonius</hi> the chiefe Originall of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Church-ſpiritualitie, leaſt we ſhould believe there is more in the effect then in the adequate cauſe, I conclude, that the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſing Church-affaires at this day, is not of divine but of humane right, and therefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> playes the Impoſtor, who prates ſo at random of the ſanctity of his Church-affaires, and of the <hi>ſpeciall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall right</hi> of exerciſing them; he is not unlike to them that falſifie coyne, who waſh braſſe, leaden or iron pieces with a little ſilver or gold to impoveriſh others, and inrich themſelves. I confeſſe that this is the old Popiſh garlick, ſticking cloſe to many, but he who will looke over the writings of all Divines (as hee brags hee hath done) may perceive that the moſt quick-ſighted Reformers have found out long ſince, that whatſoever is ſo highly talked of, the ſpeciall right of ſanctity is nothing elſe but the <hi>ſecondine</hi> of the Romiſh mother, and the pollution adhering to her ſons ſince their nativity: there is none more ſtubborne then the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> who above all others delights in the polluted blood of that Romiſh Whore, and ſips up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine her excrements, not being content with common Elogies; he prides himſelfe ſo much in the right of this priviledge, that he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every where, that the Eccleſiaſtick power is a kind of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and hath in it ſome thing that is <hi>Regall.</hi> I confeſſe, that the name of Chriſtians puts us in mind of our Kingly Office, which (as the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt ſaith) conſiſteth in this, that we ſtrive againſt ſin, and ſubdue the luſts of the fleſh, and this is common to all Chriſtians: but the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> not content with this Priviledge of a Miniſteriall right of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he makes a right of commanding and raigning in the Church, and that ſpeciall, cenſoriall, and nomotheticall; ſo that many times he calls this power under Chriſt imperiall, ſelfe-ſufficient, abſolute and regall. I confeſſe they are but trifles which he ſpreads every where, yet leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to be neglected becauſe he is not

               <p>He is wonderfully pleaſed, that Chriſt calls the Church <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> which <hi>is not of this world,</hi> but heavenly, and <hi>the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> whence he concludes, that the viſible Church is a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and that the Government thereof is like that of a Kingdome: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the power of this Government is in the Church-Rulers, that therefore their power is <hi>in a manner Kingly;</hi> ſuch are the Popiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymemes concerning a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſtick Kingdome.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, here is a fallacy in the ambiguity of the word, when they meane every where by the Church, the viſible Church; for when Chriſt ſaith, that his Kingdome is not of this world, but heavenly, he meanes the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, the greateſt part whereof is in heaven, and there raignes with Chriſt. But becauſe for the accompliſhing of this Kingdome, the <hi>viſible</hi> Church here on earth is appointed and her Miniſtery, therefore Chriſt transfers the name of the <hi>Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to the affaires of the viſible Church, not as if he meant, that the viſible Church or her Miniſtery ſhould be held for a Kingdome, or for the Kingdome of heaven, but by a knowne Metonymie he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the name of the effect, and end, to the efficient, which leads to that end: no other wayes then we uſe to ſay, that a man labours for food and rayment, whereas he workes for money, not as if <hi>money</hi> were food and rayment, but becauſe by it theſe things are procured; he deſerves to be laughed at who in ſilver ſeeketh properly for food and rayment, becauſe figuratively it is called food and rayment: as ridiculous are the Papiſts when they ſeeke in the viſible Church a regall and celeſtiall Power and dominion, becauſe it is called the Kingdome of heaven, for no other reaſon, but becauſe it is the <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> by which we attain to that bleſſed Kingdome in heaven.</p>
               <p>This is the old Papiſts Logick, to ſeek for literall concluſions out of figurative ſpeeches, which art almoſt every where the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Bapiſt borrowes from them, and chiefly in this Argument; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt calls the viſible Church and its Government a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and of <hi>heaven</hi> figuratively, he concludes that the Church-Rulers have a regall power, and that they are really and ſimply heavenly Kings; although I ſuſpect that he wrote this and many other things but in jeſt, yet I will drive out this joculary naile with another naile, that any one may ſee the abſurdity.</p>
               <p>If the viſible Church be the Kingdome of heaven truly and ſimply, (as <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith) then I will infer, that of neceſſity the Church of <hi>Midleburg</hi> is alſo literally the Kingdome of heaven, which if ſo,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114151:86"/>then I will conclude with another conſequence, that that Church is <hi>literally heaven;</hi> for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are the Kingdomes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> Hence further I conclude, that as often as the <hi>viſible</hi> Church meeteth in the temple of <hi>Middleburg,</hi> there <hi>heaven is literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and by another conſequence, as often as the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Church, <hi>he preacheth in heaven;</hi> then it muſt follow, that while he is there with his Hearers, he is not <hi>properly on the earth,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he will mingle heaven and earth together. And againe, it will follow, that becauſe he is a Ruler in that Church, and hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of cenſuring, he is not only <hi>a King,</hi> but <hi>the King of heaven</hi> too, as <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> is of hell. How bleſſed then is <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who if he doth not reigne in <hi>the earthly Conſiſtory of Middleburg,</hi> yet he is King of <hi>Middleburgian heaven.</hi> Are not then the Magiſtrates of <hi>Middleburg</hi> ſtupid, who yet doubt whether the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> be worthy of the earthly Kingdome of his Conſiſtory, whom long ago they ſee to be <hi>King of heaven?</hi> That he may reconcile theſe abſurdities, he will be forced to confeſſe, that this word of the <hi>Kingdome of heaven</hi> is figuratively and improperly attributed to the viſible Church: But if <hi>Apollonius</hi> may with Papiſts expound figurative words literally, there will be nothing certain in Divinity, but Chriſtians will be made branches, ſtones, trees, chickens, ſheep, fiſh, fruits, graſſe, corn, and what not? Of Preachers and Church-men there will be made not onely Kings, Paſtors, Captaines, Houſholders (as they will have) but ſervants, wolves, dogs, pillars, ſtones, bell-ringers, pipers, walls, flames, candle-ſticks, fires, and many more, to which the Holy Ghoſt compares them. So that if hee ſhould ſhake the budgets of moſt <hi>abſtruſe Divinity,</hi> he cannot compoſe theſe things, but he ſhall be laughed at by all. This is his errour, in that he will out of figurative ſpeeches, draw literall concluſions, as if out of painted gold, he would make a reall crowne of gold.</p>
               <p>Much of this kind he ſpreads every where; chiefly Part 2. p. 28. he doth plainly diſpute for the Kingly cenſuring power of Church-men.</p>
               <p>For (ſaith hee) the juriſdiction of the Church is called the <hi>right of the keyes,</hi> and the Churches key is called <hi>Davids key,</hi> which was regall; whence he concludes, That the <hi>juriſdiction</hi> of the Church is regall.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Theſe things are ſpoken figuratively, and to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Chriſt onely if they be taken properly, not to the moderne Church, which properly wants the keyes of heaven, as I ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:114151:86"/>
               <p>The chiefe errour is in this, that with the Pope he makes of the <hi>keyes</hi> the Scepter and regall Crowne: If all be Kings that have the right of the keyes, then the Key-bearers of Temples, Cities, Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, of Bedlems, and of all Cells, ſhall be Kings. And whereas he ſaith, that <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> key is regall, and that therefore ſuch is the key of the moderne Church; it is all one as if I ſhould ſay, there was a King who carried the keyes of the City, therefore all are Kings afterwards who carry thoſe keyes: How falſe this is, appeares in <hi>Peter,</hi> who firſt and properly received theſe keyes, and yet he was a poore Fiſher-man, not a King. Surely if <hi>Apollonius</hi> had <hi>Peters</hi> true key, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> would forbid in him all Kingly ſtate and pride, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. ſaying, <hi>The Kings of the earth beare rule, but it ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave to the Church power of <hi>judicature,</hi> which (ſaith he) is kingly.</p>
               <p>I anſwered elſewhere, that in this place <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not beſtow on the Church the right of judicature, but only to intercede and to compoſe differences. For the power of judging one to be a Publican or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, he gives properly to a Brother, not to the Church; and ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man ſhould have regall power. Truly if all be Kings that judge, there will be innumerable Kings in the ſame kingdome. If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> play not the foole, he was a King long ſince, becauſe he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the keyes, and judged many things after his manner.</p>
               <p>His chief argument is out of that place <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſending his Diſciples to preach, ſpeaks firſt of his regall power, ſaying, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth:</hi> he concludes alſo from his regall power, ſaying, <hi>I will be with you till the end of the world:</hi> thence he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That the power not onely of Chriſt, but alſo of the Church, and therefore of Miniſters, is regall: O wonderfull!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindanus</hi> indeed, and other Papiſts are ridiculous in their devices; but what Jeſuite at this day is there of any braine, who will not burſt with laughter, when he ſhall ſee and think of theſe <hi>Apollonian</hi> ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall demonſtrations, to wit, that <hi>Calviniſts</hi> by ſuch fictions doe ſeek after power to reigne in the Church, which they have hitherto execrated in the Pope.</p>
               <p>Chriſt the King of Kings ſpeaking before and after of his Kingly power, commanded the Apoſtles <hi>to teach and baptize: Ergo,</hi> he made them Kings, and indowed them with Kingly power. If <hi>Apollonius</hi> were as quick-ſighted in both his eyes as <hi>Lynx,</hi> he could not ſee this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. He reaſons thus out of his fooliſh Dialectick: As often as Kings,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114151:87"/>ſpeaking of their Majeſty, command their Heralds to publiſh their will and Letters Patents, they preſently of Heralds become Kings; that Herald were worthy of Hellebore, who would thus conclude; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the King in plaine termes ſhould tell his Meſſenger; Although my other ſervants may command and domineere in their Offices, yet I forbid thee to do ſo, neither will I permit thee to reigne: for this is the ſenſe of Chriſts words;
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Kings of the Nations beare rule, but it ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi> So we need not ſtay any longer in the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian</hi> devices, whereas we may every where ſee, that the Pope and <hi>Apollonius</hi> are both of one minde; to wit, that they have regall power, howſoever Chriſt and the whole Scripture contradict it: but by a Jeſuiticall quirk he tells us, that their power is not <hi>ſecular, carnall,</hi> or <hi>deſpoticall,</hi> (for theſe husks he leaves for the Magiſtrate, reſerving to himſelfe the <hi>pure flower of ſpirituality</hi>) but <hi>Eccleſiaſticke, holy,</hi> and <hi>celeſtiall:</hi> which becauſe it proceeds not from the ſpeciall ſanctity of their Church-Diſcipline, as the object, nor from the dignity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern vocation, as I have now ſhewed, we muſt henceforth ſearch into the other lurking holes of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Church ſanctity, leaſt theſe <hi>rattle-mice</hi> hide themſelves any longer in their under-ground caves of ſpirituality.</p>
               <p>Therefore having overthrowne the chiefe foundations of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian</hi> ſanctity and dominion, which are <hi>the ſpirituality of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Diſcipline, and the myſticall ſublimity of their calling,</hi> now I will purſue the Arguments which the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſtill uſeth to purchaſe authority to himſelfe among the ignorant, which with the Papiſts he borroweth from the <hi>Epithetes,</hi> and <hi>names</hi> given to Preachers in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which he ſtrives to eſtabliſh his regall majeſty in the Church, in this playing the canvaſſe Merchant with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which that the Reader may ſee, I will firſt in generall point at three of his ordinary fallacies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the moſt titles are figurative and metaphoricall,
<note place="margin">Fallaciae in titulis.</note> out of which he raiſeth literall concluſions, by which he muſt needs fall into a thouſand abſurdities, for if this be admitted in Divinity, that every one interpret as hee pleaſeth, figures, ſimilitudes, and metaphors, which are found in Scripture, there will be nothing certaine, but we may infer any thing out of any thing: by this reaſon, I may eaſily of <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his other Preachers, make ſtocks, ſtones, yea brute beaſts, for Church-Doctors are called in Scripture, <hi>Pillars, Foundations,</hi> and watchfull <hi>Dogs:</hi> now we know that Pillars are made of ſtocks, and ſtumps of trees, Foundations of ſtones, and that Dogs are brute
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114151:87"/>and impudent beaſts: whence the folly of old Papiſts appears, who have erected their whole Hierarchy out of parabolicall and figurative Scripture phraſes, (as famous <hi>Marnixius</hi> hath merrily demonſtrated:) and becauſe he could find no other new way to ſet up his regall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, therefore the <hi>VValachrian</hi> Papiſt walks altogether in his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors foot-ſteps. <hi>Apollonius</hi> his other errour is, that of indefinite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, he makes excluſive, and underſtands ſimply what is ſpoken reſpectively; this he borrowed alſo of the Jeſuites, for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> commonly thus concludes: Chriſt gave the keyes to <hi>Peter, Ergo,</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> alone; Chriſt ſaid to Peter <hi>ſeed my ſheep,</hi> and <hi>when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted confirme thy Brethren: Ergo,</hi> this power he gave to <hi>Peter</hi> only, to <hi>feed his ſheep,</hi> and to ſtrengthen all his Brethren of the whole world, and which is all one, to reigne over all the people and Kings of the earth; whence he leaps with eaſe to the Pope, <hi>Peters</hi> fucceſſor, that he may conclude theſe inſpeakable priviledges to belong to him alone: the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> doth excellently well follow this Jeſuiticall Divinity; for as often as he finds in Scripture that Teachers are called Biſhops, Captains, Fathers, &amp;c. he preſently concludes, that this right belongs alwayes and abſolutely to Miniſters alone, as we ſhall ſee in what followeth.</p>
               <p>His third fraud is, that of conditionall propoſitions he makes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and applies to himſelfe thoſe priviledges which belonged one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Apoſtles, or at this day appertaine to them, under a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, who have things requiſite for theſe priviledges: this is the play of old Papiſts: when the Church is called the mother of Chriſtians, which title belongs onely to the Catholike and truly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Church, they underſtand this of all the Church, or at leaſt, of their Romiſh. When it is ſaid of Teachers, <hi>He that heareth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth you, heareth or rejecteth Chriſt;</hi> which is onely true abſolutely of the Apoſtles, and of infallible Preachers, they underſtand this of themſelves, chiefly of the Pope; although they confeſſe him to be a moſt impure monſter. This <hi>VValachrian</hi> Papiſt ſpeaketh in the ſame dialect; whatſoever in Scripture is ſaid of the Church, of preaching, of vocation, of cenſuring, and of the keyes, being holy and ſpirituall, as under the Apoſtles, this he interprets of his moderne Church and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, in which he is as ſottiſh, as if ſome <hi>Caiaphas</hi> or <hi>Ananias,</hi> who were wicked High Prieſts in the time of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Paul,</hi> had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to themſelves the praiſes and titles that were given to <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Zadoc;</hi> who then lived when the holy of holies, and all the ſacred things of the Temple did ſhine with divine honour, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114151:88"/>in Chriſts time were polluted with many ſpots and vices, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did they loſe the circumſtances, but almoſt the whole ſubſtance of ſanctity; or if ſome Impoſtor and Money-changer ſhould brag that his coyne were ſound and currant, which being brought to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the gold-weights, or triall of defraying of charges, will bee found to be baſe metall, adulterated coyne, and to be waſhed, light and clipped: what I have now ſaid in generall, I would have to bee obſerved, for in every Epithete that the Papiſts brag of, you ſhall find nothing but ſophiſtry.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> prides himſelfe every where in this title,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Titulus membrum principale.</hi>
                  </note> that he is the <hi>eye, eare, hand</hi> and the Prince, a Member of the Church: whence he goeth about to perſwade unwary men, that to him and ſuch as he, belongs an Authoritative Government in the Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that theſe titles are no where to be found ſpoken plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Preachers, but are conſequentially onely drawne out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which way of demonſtration, as we have ſaid, is not ſure, but inclining to error.</p>
               <p>But if this were ſpoken plainely, it were a figurative ſpeech and metaphoricall, which if wreſted imprudently, would beget many abſurdities: ſuppoſe one to be an <hi>eye, eare, noſe</hi> and <hi>hand</hi> in the Church, what wiſe man will thence conclude, that whatſoever belongs to theſe Members in the body, belongs to him? The eye is moſt tender, round, inconſtant, and moveable, it alone ſheds tears, it ſhews in what we delight, and is the window of impudency: The noſe is in the middeſt of the face, jetting out, ſwelling, breathing in and out ayre, and pride, and the inſtrument of indignation; ſo if I ſhould philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically ſpeake of the eares, hand, and other members, many things will be raiſed which may belong to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> but with diſgrace he will ſay, I ſuppoſe that it is the property of the eye to ſee and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, of the noſe to ſmell, of the eares to heare, of the hands to work: whence the dignity and office of Miniſters may be borrowed, but who will perſwade us that theſe ſimilitudes do note onely vertues and not vices in Miniſters? but if we ſhould grant, that there be eyes in the Church to ſee, eares to heare, and that the chiefe parts are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for chiefe functions, by what art can he perſwade us, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative belongs to Preachers onely?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> truly in two places ſpeaks excellently of the diverſity, uſe and conſent of the principall and ſervile parts of mans body, and of the Church; but he that will diligently weigh all things ſhall finde no where, that it was <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning in thoſe places to give to Preachers,

               <p>The anſwer is eaſie, I deny not but the office of a Biſhop is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but hence it followeth not, that therefore Biſhops muſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere, for ſo the baſeſt members of our body, and which ſerve for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſhould be chiefe in the body, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor is given to the <hi>weaker,</hi>

<note place="margin">Act. 20. 1 Tim. 5.17.</note> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to all Elders, yea it belonged to Deacons under the Apoſtles; ſo that here Kingly power is not to remaine in the ſuperlative ſanctity of Paſtors, but it muſt paſſe to the comparative of Elders, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive of Deacons. I need not then tell, that it was common to all Lay-men and the Church-members, under the Apoſtles, to teack, and conſequently to exerciſe the office of a Biſhop, however the <hi>Stile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walker</hi> may cunningly goe about to unfold himſelfe of theſe, yet this is ſure, that Epiſcopall dignity did of old belong by a certaine prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, to the Apoſtles, and not now to Popiſh Biſhops, becauſe by this right the Biſhop of Rome excerciſeth regall power, but he can have no leiſure to teach Chriſts people. This new <hi>VValachrian</hi> Papiſt by this his unſavory writing, ſhewes, that he wants either power or will to provide for, and give light to Gods people being hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of ſo many falſhoods, whence it may bee juſtly concluded, that though Kingly power were contained under Epiſcopacy, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him, as being no Biſhop.</p>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:114151:90"/>drawes the Popes mighty Majeſty over all Chriſtian Monarchs: For, becauſe it was ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheep,</hi> he concludes, that to <hi>Peter</hi> belenged the right of feeding all ſheep: And becauſe that right was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> he inferres, that it was alſo given to the Pope, <hi>as to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he ſhould feed all Chriſts ſheep.

<q>Tytere coge pecus.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>This device pleaſeth the new Popiſh <hi>Walachrian:</hi> for he ſpeaks ſo often of his <hi>authoritative</hi> office of feeding, that of his <hi>Shepheards crooke</hi> he makes a <hi>ſword,</hi> yea a <hi>regall Scepter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: The title of Paſtor is figurative; therefore by an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence do Popiſh Paſtors draw to themſelves whatſoever is found in earthly Shepheards and ſheep. At this day Shepheards are a mean and ſervile kind of people, which being unfit for other imployment, are of meane ſpirits, and fit onely to conſume victualls: ſo the Poet deſcribes the lazie Shepheard <hi>Tyterus,</hi> ſtretching himſelfe along in the ſhade, and ſinging love-ſongs of his fair <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> This paſtorall ſport Pope <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrand</hi> that ſpirituall Shepheard ſhewed, when expecting that <hi>Honry</hi> the fourth Emperour ſhould come to <hi>Canoſſa</hi> in an humble way, he betooke himſelfe to the tower of <hi>Mathildis,</hi> that in the meane while he might delight himſelfe with his <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> Yet I do not think this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Shepheard will be proud of theſe paſtorall vertues: ſo that I doubt whether he will have applied to himſelfe all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found in Shepheards.</p>
               <p>So I will ſay of <hi>ſheep:</hi> Chriſts ſpirituall ſheep differ much from our ordinary ones; for theſe are bruitiſh foure-footed beaſts, wooll-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which can neither reaſon nor ſpeake, but onely bleat. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Lay-men among Papiſts are of little better account with their ſpirituall Church-men; yet this I will ſay for Chriſts holy ſheep, that they differ much from bruit beaſts, not onely becauſe his ſheep are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, but alſo that a ſheep in Chriſts flock may become a Shepheard, and a Shepheard a ſheep: which change were miraculous in other ſheep, but in Chriſts flock it is no rare thing: for if <hi>to feed,</hi> be to <hi>teach and rule,</hi> as Papiſts ſay, we ſhall finde, that among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles this was uſuall, that he who taught to day, was taught to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for <hi>Apollos</hi> taught <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> as a Paſtor doth ſheep: but <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> taking him apart, did inſtruct him more particularly, and of ſheep became Shepheards, but the Shepheard
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114151:90"/>himſelfe became a ſheep. Neither will the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> deny but they oftentimes ſit among ſheep and diſciples, who are ſuch profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in their ſtudies, that they become Teachers, and of ſheep Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards. I know this transformation is not liked by Papiſts, becauſe they will be alwayes Shepheards, but never ſheep. Yet this is true in Chriſts ſpirituall flock, that ſuch a change oftentimes there is; whence appeares the fooliſhneſſe of Papiſts, who from a metaphoricall title of Paſtor conclude, that they may do to Chriſts reaſonable ſheep what our common Shepheards do to their bruitiſh flocks. Similitudes muſt never be drawne further then his meaning that uſeth them, except we will go beyond the compaſſe.</p>
               <p>The name of Paſtor in Scripture is given to Kings, to ſhew their moderation; it is alſo given to Church-Rulers, but with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, and prohibition to reigne: <hi>Let Kings beare rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 5.</note> ſaith Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>it ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> forbids Paſtors to <hi>domineere,</hi> but Papiſts are carried with a contrary ſpirit, who from this title draw their authority over the Church.</p>
               <p>For their Paſtorall <hi>rod</hi> at this day is very <hi>imperious, powerfull</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> and it hath two keyes faſtned to it the one is <hi>preaching,</hi> the other is <hi>juriſdiction or cenſuring,</hi> which old and new Papiſts uſe as a ſword to ſtrike and puſh with, but in a different way: For the Pope being Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and an old Sheep-ſtealer in Chriſts flocke, cares no more for the preaching top of the Shepheard ſtaffe; for though in Scripture, to <hi>feed</hi> be to <hi>preach,</hi> and <hi>teach,</hi> yet in the Popes and Jeſuites expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to feed is to be <hi>filent</hi> as a dumb dog. For if any man be ſtout in preaching the truth, he is oftentimes choſen to be of the Popes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, that his mouth may be ſtopped; ſo that out of the Popes Court to <hi>feed</hi> is to <hi>teach,</hi> but within his Court or Conclave, to <hi>fied</hi> is not to <hi>teach,</hi> but <hi>to be ſilent. Bellarmine</hi> to waſh of this blot, ſaith, it is not convenient that the Pope ſhould teach by himſelfe, it ſufficeth us, if he teach by others whom he ſends abroad, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Timethy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> whom he left in <hi>Creet,</hi> that he might from towne to towne ordaine Preachers: This ſubterfuge of the Jeſuit is pleaſant, but ſaine, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles did not onely preach by others, but chiefly by themſelves; the Pope never preacheth himſelfe but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; however the matter be, this is certain, that the Pope contents himſelfe with the ſole judiciall top of his Paſtorall ſtaffe; for although he doth not abaſe himſelfe to preach, yet in this he abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his Paſtorall Office, in that he rules the whole Church of Chriſt, by preſcribing Lawes, hearing of Princes Embaſſadours, dividing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114151:91"/>and Crownes, beſtowing Lands out of the plenitude of his power, waging warres for <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony as <hi>Julius</hi> did, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Kings and Princes as diſobedient ſheep, and compelling them to come as ſupplicants to him, and by ſetting all the Chriſtian world together by the eares, or if he be of a more moderate diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then by erecting of obelisks, building of Caſtles, adorning of Theaters and Stages, making of ſumptuous feaſts, delighting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his Ganymedes and many things els, by which he is thought to have abundantly ſatisfied his Paſtorall charge; ſo that Chriſtians may eaſily ſee, that this Romane Paſtor is not onely a hireling, but a thief alſo and a robber.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Walachrian</hi> Popiſh Dwarf uſeth as yet both the tops of his Paſtorall rod, and becauſe the <hi>judiciall</hi> is too weake to ſubdue and knock downe all as he pleaſeth, he prefers the <hi>preaching</hi> top as yet, that if he dreame at home of any thing which may advance his Hierarchie, this preſently hee perſwades the unwarie people by his declamations; or if the Magiſtrates like rams, puſh with their hornes, and take upon them to reprove their Paſtors more boldly then becomes brutiſh ſheep to doe, then out of the Pulpit openly he accuſeth them of Atheiſme, and indirectly ſtirs up againſt them all the ſheep, that is the people; that ſeldome doth he lay aſide this top of his Shepheards crock, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he grow hoarſe and ſpeechleſſe. Yet it is thought he takes not ſo much delight in his preaching rod, but that with the great Pope he could be content to lay it downe, if he could light upon a good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick in England, or a Superintendency elſewhere, that ſo hee might be ſilent by himſelfe, but preach by others: The other top, to wit <hi>judiciall,</hi> is ſurely very ſacred to him, ſo that there is nothing more Paſtorall with him then to have power of inſpection into all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to be preſent at all mens tables and affaires, to intrap the honors and eſtates of all: laſtly, to meddle with every worldly thing, with his Paſtorall crooke, to rule all, and be ruled by none; in which hee doth finely imitate the Popes Paſtorſhip, but falls quite off from that of the Apoſtles, and of <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, who preſcribes to Paſtors <hi>rule without command,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.</note> but this man requires command without <hi>rule,</hi> which may end either in Papall tyranny, or into a ſeditious Anarchy, that each Paſtor may doe what he pleaſe.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114151:91"/>that I muſt oftentimes ſay the Apoſtles were ſuch Shepheards who were content to be uppermoſt and lowermoſt, to rule and to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but Papiſts are ſuch who think it blaſphemy and Simony, if in Church-matters they be ſubject to any except to Chriſt alone imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>

               <p>Surely if <hi>Paul</hi> meanes by theſe words, <hi>the Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> that we ſhould alwayes reſt in the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuffrages, as in a truth defined by ſuch Houſholders as are at this day; then Chriſtians will be forced againſt ſcience and conſcience oftentimes to ſubmit to it, which is both falſe and unjuſt: for how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth this fall out, which <hi>Calvin</hi> complaines of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> namely, that a hundred horned Aſſes may agree by their votes in a falſhood, if ninety nine on the other ſide ſtand for the truth, that greater number muſt decide I warrant you a matter of ſuch weight. Neither ſhould they except here, that they were falſe Biſhops, and that it is otherwiſe in thoſe that are pious and reformed: For even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch there will be found no certainty, except they be all divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired, and infallible, as under the Apoſtles; or one at leaſt, which the Jeſuites (but falſly) ſay, is the Pope; and ſo in this they end all controverſies. But the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Juglers, becauſe they dare not aſſever this, they muſt neceſſarily run round, ſo that they as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Family, muſt and muſt not ſtill be believed. For, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may perſwade unwarie people, that their commands are authoritative and unblameable, and that therefore they muſt be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet if by learned men they be brought to the ſcales or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, they will be forced to confeſſe, that in many things they fall foule, and deceive others; which we may even ſee in theſe patched peeces of the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> which not onely this proud Houſholder of Chriſt vents abroad for Oracles, but he hath taken for his defence the whole company of Claſſiaries, whom the reader may ſee, have aſſented to lies, blaſphemies and toyes.</p>
               <p>It is moſt ſure, that now neither in the Church, nor in the whole world, are there any ſuch Paſtors or Houſholders, to whom ſhe can or ſhould be abſolutely ſubject, but the judgement of this remaines in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114151:92"/>the examination of every one, according to the ballance of Gods Word alone. I know that a great many Chriſtians are in this point either out of careleſneſſe, or out of ſuperſtition, very ſupine, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Preacher in many things with an implicit faith; but this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine careleſneſſe coſts the loſſe of innumerable ſoules: ſo that theſe authoritative, and domineering Houſholders are to blame, who hunt after honour out of Chriſtians blind obedience.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>VValachrian</hi> Papiſts had conſidered with what reſtriction that elect veſſell <hi>Paul</hi> had given to himſelfe the title of Houſholder,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.2.</note> the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> had not ſo often (to patronize his pride) alledged this title; for, <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in that place uſeth the title of Miniſter or Servant <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For he ſaith in the place quoted, that Magiſtrates are no where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chriſts Embaſſadours</hi> but onely <hi>Miniſters and Vicars of God.</hi> In
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114151:93"/>this his device hee varieth much from his owne <hi>Calvin,</hi> who very where honoureth Magiſtrates with the title of Gods Legats; and ſurely had he well weighed what he wrote, he would have ſeen that more belongs to the Magiſtrate then to Church-men, becauſe they have the title of Vicar, which is more then Legat: For, I ſearce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>Apollonjus</hi> will willingly aſſume to himſelfe the title of Chriſts Vicar, leaſt he ſhould make himſelfe too like the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who deſpiſing the title of <hi>Legate,</hi> calls himſelfe <hi>Chriſts Vicar,</hi> ſo that we may laugh at <hi>Apollonius</hi> his giddineſſe, who would out of the greater title faſten upon Magiſtrates the leſſer dignity, but contrary on Church-men, greater honour out of the leſſer title.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſeeks out another mote; for he makes a ſtrange diſtinction between Gods Kingdome and Chriſts, or between <hi>Chriſts Kingdome of mediation and creation,</hi> making that much more worthy and holy then this: whence he collects, that he is farre to be preferred to all Magiſtrates, becauſe theſe are onely Gods Legates, but he is Chriſts Legate, as being the <hi>Mediator exalted,</hi> as if he would have ſomething more worthy and holy then God himſelfe: I confeſſe I envy not this extortioner of phraſes that every novelty may pleaſe him, onely this I ſay, that this his device is nothing to purpoſe; for <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. deſcribing Chriſts Kingdome as Mediator, ſaith, that by right and in recompence of the work of mediation as it were by which he did exceedingly humble himſelfe, was given to him the chiefe honour, as being God and man, not onely to fit at the right hand of God the Father, but that alſo by a wonderfull diſpenſation, the Father from that time hath ſubmitted all power, and beſtowed on <hi>Chriſt the Mediator,</hi> which he will not lay downe before the end of the world, and after judgement will deliver it up to his Father. This the Apoſtle calls a myſtery, and I confeſſe I am ignorant of it; yet I adore it. Hence this aſſertion of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>For if Chriſt after his Aſcenſion alone reigne in heaven, earth, and under the earth, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) then it muſt follow, that all Kings and Magiſtrates, even Turks and Gentiles, belong to Chriſts Mediatorie Kingdome: and that they are the Vicars and Legats of Chriſt the Mediator: for how can they be the Legats of any other Prince, when as he alone reignes every where? So that of neceſſity the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Commentators muſt hatch ſome other fiction, whoſe practice I compared elſwhere to Swine turning up dunghills.</p>
               <p>Now I adde, that to expreſſe this <hi>Impoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> by the picture of a <hi>Heg,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:114151:94"/>is an Egyptian Hieroglyphick: for this is the property of that filthy beaſt, to have cloven feet, as the cleane beaſts have, with which they are alwayes dividing dirt and clay, yet never divides, or freeth it ſelfe from filth, becauſe naturally it delights in dirt: Even ſo we ſee the <hi>Walachrian</hi> hereticks dividing their fooleries with many diſtinctions, like impure hogs, parting the dirt with their cloven hoofs; and yet they never free themſelves from their errors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Walachrian</hi> chiefe errour is, that raſhly and moſt falſly they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to themſelves the title of <hi>Chriſts Legate,</hi> no other wayes then the Jewes of old bragged of the Temple, and the Papiſts now of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That one may be the Kings Embaſſadour, two things are required: that he may carrie his <hi>badge,</hi> and may ſhew his Letters of credence, that he is the Kings Embaſſadour: The other, that he may have his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> concerning the Kings will and command; ſo that when he wills he may ſhew all things ready for his Embaſſie. For, if either of theſe be wanting, the whole honour of his Embaſſie failes: ſo that if one take upon him to be an Embaſſadour, and having the badges, yet go beyond his commiſſion, either out of ignorance, or malice, he ſhall not be a true Legate. Againe, if one do faithfully deliver the Kings will as a Legate, and yet have no right, or any thing to ſhew for his Embaſſie, he alſo is not to be accounted the Kings Embaſſadour; and it hath oftentimes been ſeen, that ſuch Legates have been puniſhed by Princes, as Impoſtors.</p>
               <p>If according to this rule the Pope be examined, he will be found to be Antichriſt: If you ask for his Letters Patents of Embaſſie, he will tell you, that he ſits in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, and that from perſon to perſon, from <hi>Peter</hi> to himſelfe, this right was derived, to wit, by true electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many other things with which he belyeth his Letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If you make inquirie into his inſtructions, though many Popes were nothing but Monſters, deſpiſers of divine and humane Lawes, yet they ſay that he is infallible, by the vertue of his Chaire, that he hath all Lawes <hi>within the cabinet of his breſt.</hi> This fiction is thruſt upon men, under many ambiguities, and now for many hundred yeares hath ſo prevailed in Popery, that he who doubts to yeeld to thus, ſhall be compelled to yeeld to arguments taken from excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, priſon, faggots and death. This is the old Popery.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt brags much more unſeemingly of his Embaſſie; becauſe he is forced to confeſſe, that he hath no Letters to ſhew for his employment, nor any wayes ſo inſtructed, as to deſerve
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114151:94"/>the name of Chriſts Embaſſadour: for I will aske him, what certaine badges hath he to ſhew that he is Chriſts Legate? he will doubtieſſe ſay, he hath badges or markes in that he was choſen by the Church, that is, elected and ordained to preach by an outward company of men profeſſing Chriſt, but this is to prove the ſame by the ſame; for then the queſtion will be, where did Chriſt ſay, that he would account him for his Legate who is choſen and ordained at this day to preach by an Aſſembly of Chriſtians? If there were now ſuch a King who ſhould acknowledge for his Embaſſadours ſuch as ſhould take upon them this function by ſome evill and ſiniſtrous wayes, he ſhould be held an inconſiderate Prince, and little carefull of his honour. How unworthy a thing is it then to ſuſpect this of Chriſt ſo great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, that he would ſo proſtitute the glorious right of his <hi>Embaſſie</hi> in holy things, that he ſhould preſently acknowledge for his Vicars and Legates, who can ſhew onely the externall pomp of Vocation? This fiction was long ſince exploded among the old Papiſts, yet wee deny not but they had ſome kind of calling, but becauſe it was not juſtly performed and according to Chriſts preſcript, it is therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as none.</p>
               <p>Though I will not aſcribe the ſame degree of impudencie to thoſe <hi>Walachrians,</hi> yet if <hi>Apollonius</hi> will confeſſe what he knoweth, there is nothing more certaine then that the whole manner of Vocation there is humane, and oftentimes carnall; ſo that I thinke it a moſt unworthy thing that Chriſt ſhould be ſo looſe and profuſe in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honour of this Embaſſie, whereas it is as eaſie in a Brokers ſhop of old cloaths to find a ſute for a noble man, as it is there by force or favour, to acquire through <hi>Apollonian</hi> ſpirituall Arts the title of Chriſts Legate.</p>
               <p>Now for matter of <hi>inſtruction:</hi> If it be demanded, I have ſhewed before, that there is no man at this day who dare ſay, he is infallible: For, as ſoon as the Scribes in their preaching departed from the chaire, or reading of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in Chriſts time, they did eaſily admit the leaven of their owne traditions in their doctrine, of which Chriſt will have us take heed, though nevertheleſſe he will have us hearken to them, ſo long as they ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chaire, that is, continue in the ſimple reading. So this writing of <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſhewes what is done in the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Claſſis, who placing the authority of his Embaſſie not in reading, but in declamatory preaching, hath been divers times convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by me of errour, and found to have departed from the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his King: whence he ſeems to me to be no leſſe ſottiſh, when
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114151:95"/>he obtrudes a corrupt calling, and fallible preaching, for Chriſts true Embaſſie, then if he would pay his debts, by painting on a piece of board the figures and colours of divers coynes, and ſo give them to his creditor inſtead of paiment. Here is no obſcure report, that the Eccleſiaſtick ſpirituality of <hi>Apollonius</hi> is ſo ruinous there, that not onely out of the poſitive ſanctity of Deacons, the comparative of Elders, but (which is a wonder) from the ſuperlative of Preachers, this ſhamefull diſgrace hath proceeded,
<note place="margin">Verſuram facere fore cedere.</note> that ſome there out of a baſe intent to defraud men, tooke up money upon uſe to pay their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and plaid bankerupts. If it pleaſe <hi>Apollonius</hi> to help his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with ſuch a paiment, that he may beſtow upon him a large ſum of painted money on a board, I will give him leave to uſe his bounty; yet he ſhall no more ſatisfie his creditors there by paying painted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for true, then by obtruding upon us here the ſhadowes and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of his calling and preaching, when he would ſhew us the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt honour of his Embaſſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> indeed and the Apoſtles might glory, that they were Chriſts Embaſſadours, becauſe they were ſent immediately <hi>neither from men, nor by men;</hi> whence they were furniſhed with the badges of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with piety of life, infallibility of doctrine, and power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. This Embaſſie of Chriſt, as being an Apoſtolicall function, was onely in them, and ended in them. The dignity of Evangeliſts was ſomewhat leſſe, who wrote from their mouths, as <hi>Luke;</hi> or taught,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.1.</note> as <hi>Timothie;</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth to have heard the doctrine of ſalvation <hi>from his mouth among many witneſſes;</hi> and warnes him that he ſhould <hi>commit it to faithfull men,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2.</note> and apt to teach;</hi> ſuch was <hi>Titus:</hi> Theſe were not Chriſts immediate Legats, but the Apoſtles, to whom notwithſtanding it belonged to ſpeak <hi>with authority,</hi> as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> tranſlates it; or, <hi>with command,</hi> as <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For although their Embaſſie was much different from that of the Apoſtles, yet ſo long as they lived, they could have recourſe to them. They alſo ſhewed a great meaſure of ſpirituall gifts in themſelves: ſo that not without cauſe their authority was great in the Church, yet not as Chriſts proper and immediate Legates, but of the Apoſtles; yet they were divine, and excelled in the gifts of the Spirit. Since their departure, that glorious way of calling and conferring of gifts by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands ceaſed, that ſcarce three hundred yeares after Chriſt did there any whit of this rare vocation remaine: yea Antichriſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the place of gifts, all ſorts of corruption and vices ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And yet if we look upon the lights of ancient times, namely,

                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> yea <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the yeare 1300.

<note place="margin">Heb. 1.5</note> 
                  <hi>no man takes unto himſelfe this honour but he who is called of God, as Aaron was, and Chriſt:</hi> whence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it is temeritie for any man after Chriſt to take upon him the priviledge of this title, yet Antichriſt the old Romiſh Pope durſt doe it, priding himſelfe in this as in many other things, that he hath ſucceeded Chriſt as his Vicar and high Prieſt in the Militant Church.

               <p>But theſe parabolicall alluſions are of little weight among wiſe men, if in Scripture ſometimes the title of <hi>Huſband</hi> or <hi>Bridegroome</hi> were given to Miniſters; but it is ſo farre from this, that in it we find the Baptiſt conferring this honour on Chriſt alone, <hi>that he is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome becauſe he hath the Bride,</hi> reſerving to himſelfe the title of <hi>friend</hi> onely: which modeſty is farre different from the pride of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Papiſts, who boldly prate that they are the Bridegroomes and therefore have the Bride. I think that it is more injurious to Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable honour, for one to call himſelfe a Vicar, Bridegroom or Husband, then the Miniſteriall head of the Church. Concerning the indignity of this laſt, many books have been written againſt the Pope, whereas notwithſtanding it is evident, that this involves no diſhonour to Chriſt, if he have under him a Miniſteriall held, but it containes obſcoenity, for one to be called <hi>Vicar, Bridegroome,</hi> or <hi>ſecondary Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> of Chriſts Church upon earth.</p>
               <p>But I will not ſpend time about this as any great matter, I will only drive this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt to quotlibetary fooleries, by which he may with his old friends, delight or vex himſelfe.</p>
               <p>For firſt I will aske if a Paſtor or Preacher be the Bridegroom or Husband of the Church, what kind of Husbands were the Apoſtles, who had no particular Church, but had the care of all? If he ſay, they were not Husbands or Bridegroomes, which they themſelves would have eaſily acknowledged, he will make them leſſe worthy then the <hi>Walachrian</hi> night-birds: but if on the contrary he doe confeſſe it, he will bring upon them the ſuſpition of bawdrie, as though they had power every where to lie with other mens wives. Which monſter <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his Alcoran did challenge to himſelfe, that according to his propheticall majeſty, he might have power to leap into every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bed.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he ſaith, that the Church is married to ordinary Paſtors, I aske, whether it be not an unſeemly thing for one woman to have many husbands, which no Law doth allow? and yet in this ſpirituall marriage there is nothing more common: for, many Churches have two, three, foure Paſtors, and perhaps the Church of <hi>Middleburg</hi> hath many more, and conſequently husbands; which if he ſhall make uſe of as his Vicars to lie with his wife, <hi>Apollonius</hi> himſelfe will make
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114151:96"/>her to be ſuſpected of adultery, except he be aſſured that ſhe will be loyall to him as the cheif husband, yet he ſhall carrie the hornes, when he gives way to his colleagues as his underlings to make uſe of her.</p>
               <p>But if one Church be duly married to one husbands, I aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if any thing can be more proper for marriage then indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility? but in this holy and ſpirituall wedding there is nothing more abſurd; for no ſooner doe young men leave the Schoole, but out of the heat of their youth they begin to be ſuiters, neither is there any Church ſo meane and poor, to which they will not make ſuite, as if ſhee were the faireſt Bride in the World, if ſo be ſhee will confer upon them a paſtorall Cloak and a ſtipend; but this is not with any intention to ſtay alwayes with this wife, but like inſects, they gather company, till they can get wings, with which they may flie higher; which when they have got, they take no longer delight in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wives, but like adulterers they begin to woe other women, which are much more beautifull, either becauſe of rich Citizens, or Citie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, or for ſome others worldly reſpect. And thoſe ſpirituall husbands are oftentimes ſo impudently importunate, that not onely do they uſe unlawfull wayes to obtaine their <hi>new Brides,</hi> but make ſuch haſte alſo, that before the former be lawfully divorſed, they marry with the later.</p>
               <p>Now I will aske this alſo: if the Church be the Miniſters wife, how will it ſtand with the chaſtity of Wedlock, that a buſie Miniſter, who loves other mens fruit better then his own, ſhould go to delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in other Provinces, and leave his Church to other ſpirituall Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that they may performe the dues of Matrimony to her? Is not he a Bawde to his own wife? eſpecially if by gluttony or ſloth, his meanes being ſpent, this Husband of the Church be forced to ſaile to the <hi>Indies,</hi> or ſome other part of the world, to recover his loſſes, in which caſe he forſakes his Wife, and for the time joynes himſelf to a richer, and leſt ſhee ſhould be forſaken like a Widow, ſome other Husband ſucceeds in the place of the former, who notwithſtanding doth not ſuffer himſelf to be divorted totally from the former Wife, but reſerves a power to return to her if this later afterwards diſpleaſe him. Many things could be alledged againſt the Eccleſiaſtick marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Miniſters and their Churches, which ſeem to me ſo immodeſt, that if it be true what theſe night-birds whiſper, that Miniſters are the Husbands of their Churches, all Churches will be accounted bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and Miniſters Bawdes or Whooremongers, but enough of this title.</p>

               <p>There is one thing remaining for eſtabliſhing of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Kingdom, which I wonder, that he who is in every thing the Popes Ape, did not alſo borrow this of him: there is a notable place in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 1.10.</note> where God ſending the Prophet as his Ambaſſador, doth inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurate him with this high elogie, <hi>Behold this day I ſet thee over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, to pluck up and demoliſh, to destroy and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, to build and to plant,</hi> &amp;c. If this elogie ſhould be taken literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you would think it gave ſo much power to <hi>Jeremie,</hi> that it might ſeem he had leave to command imperiouſly all Kings and Nations; but <hi>Jeremie</hi> by his own example taught that this was not to be taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; becauſe he ſo performed that great Ambaſſie, that floating through divers injuries, opprobrious ſpeeches, priſons, and many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he preached Gods judgements in great humility. The Pope who ſtrangely deſpiſeth Gods word, hath farre otherwiſe expounded this elogie; for <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, in the <hi>Bull</hi> by which he excommunicated <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> in the yeere 1588. ſo takes theſe words, that by them he aſſumes power to overthrow the whole Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> for performing of which he had <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> ready as his executioner, who by his mighty Fleet of a 150. Ships reſolved then to invade that Kingdom, and by the Popes command to extinguiſh all the Proteſtants, but that paper-thunder vaniſhed into the wind: it appeares then by his Popes <hi>Bull</hi> what his ſpirituall power is, that if he cannot by himſelf immediatly, yet by his ſouldiers he may overthrow Kingdoms and Nations with the ſpirituall Sword of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that by the ſame priviledge which <hi>Jeremie</hi> had, who though he was the firſt poſſeſſor thereof, yet took ſo ſmall pride in it, that he plainly ſhew by the moderation of his life, that he could ſee no ſuch thing in that priviledge, as the Pope by his new interpretation draws from it, but what can be expected elſe <hi>from Antichriſt (the man of ſin, and ſonne of perdition?)</hi> the <hi>Walachrian Stilt-walker,</hi> conſcious of his own weakneſſe, durſt never (as I know) apply this elogie to himſelfe; who notwithſtanding ſeemes to obſerve his clandeſtine counſels, and machinations, which he is daily practiſing againſt the Magiſtrates of <hi>Middleburg;</hi> they ſay that there is nothing he deſires more, then that he may once have power to overthrow and extirpate the Government of that famous City, by the ſeverity of which alone, he perceives that his unbridled deſire of domineering is curbed, and though no cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme is with him of greater eſteeme (as is thought) then that he may recommend to truſtie men the care, to leave no occaſion unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted for overthrowing the foundations of that Government, and

               <p>I have briefly touched the elogies by which Papiſts do every where extoll the majeſty of their Church, ſome whereof are fained, and not found in Scripture; moſt are figurative and metaphoricall: but all conditionall; which ſhew not what Miniſters are, but what they ſhould be, to wit; Paſtors, Leaders, Fathers and Overſeers of the Church, and ſo they are to be accounted, if they be endowed with gifts requiſite for theſe Functions, and uſe them aright: wherefore when Teachers were divinely inſpired, the calling divine and impoſition of hands effectuall, Chriſtians might lawfully reſt in, and give obedience to their Paſtors and Leaders as unto faithfull Fathers, Biſhops, and Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, even as to God or Chriſt himſelf, becauſe they were infallible; but this happineſſe laſted not long; for even whilſt the Apoſtles were living, falſe brethren crept into Churches, who proud of their elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and vocation, durſt equall, yea preferre themſelves to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſo that theſe Divine men then gave warning to Chriſtians not to beleve abſolutely every ſpirit, but firſt to examine according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture whether or not theſe ſpirits were of God. If Chriſtians then ſtood in need of ſuch circumſpection, when there were ſo many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>Teachers,</hi> to whom they might in blind obedience ſafely truſt their ſoules; how carefull now muſt we be of our ſalvation, when for the ſpace of ſo many hundred yeers there hath been none found in all the world whom God hath ſo aſſiſted with infallibility, as that we may ſafely rely upon him? the Pope hath now for a long time ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewitched the world in making Chriſtians beleeve he is infallible; and this ſupine credulity hath in Gods juſt judgement caſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoules into hell: nor is the Pope onely guity of this remerity, there is no Monk or Prieſt ſo drunk, as will not bragge of the character of his vocation, and boldly cry out that he is a <hi>Captain,</hi> a <hi>Watchman</hi> of ſouls, as ſet over the ſouls of men, a <hi>Houſhelder</hi> of heaven, an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Chriſt, which is performed by theſe brawlers with ſuch eagernes oftentimes, that they imprecate all curſes againſt themſelves, and pawne their bodies and ſouls to the people, if they teach or lead them otherwayes then they ſhould, though ſome of the wiſer ſort ſmell that theſe are meere Impoſtors of which they br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>WE have hitherto ſeen the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> eloquence in extolling their modern Eccleſiaſtick buſineſſes, which is done by them who in <hi>Walachria</hi> are called [Church-men] and [Spirituall] as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papiſts [Clergy-men.] And we have ſhewed that there is not in all their Church-diſcipline any thing ſacred, particularly or ſpecially, as to keep off Chriſtians by any right of ſanctity from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing them, if they be furniſhed with gifts fit for them: And that there is now no manner of inauguration by ſpeciall Divine right, for any man to exerciſe alone theſe Affairs, (<hi>authoritavely</hi> or <hi>poteſtatively,</hi> as he ſpeaks.) For, Vocation, Election, and Conſecration by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, at this day, are meerly humane and corrupted means, in which we ſee by experience there is no Spirituall efficacie; for they are performed by Simony, fraud, and wicked wayes, that ſeldome is the fitteſt man choſen, but commonly ſuch as promiſes, bribes, and favour promoteth. Impoſition alſo of hands, retaining the forme, but not the force of the ancient inſtitution, is not found to conferre any
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114151:101"/>Spirituall gifts; only we find, that ſuch as have obtained the pomp of external Vocation, are puffed up with Apollonian and Papiſtical pride, as if they were filled with new and infuſed ſanctity; that is, As ſoon as young Fellows are freed from the laſh of the Schoolmaſters rod, having got Ordination, and the priviledge of Eccleſiaſtick character, within three dayes after they think themſelves more ſpirituall then all the Magiſtrates and common Members of the Church. But if they want the knowledge of Tongues, Sciences, and good Arts, they are not found by Impoſition of hands to be made more learned: Yet if any before his Vocation be a Trifler, Cheater, Drunkard or wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, it ſeldome falls out that afterward he leaves theſe vices, but only hides them warily, leſt he loſe his Miniſterial ſtipend. A fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we ſee in this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt, who long hath bragged of the right of his Church-calling, and yet hath not forgot to lie, cheat, and blaſpheme the Magiſtrates. I know that in the Apoſtles time the matter was otherwiſe, becauſe of the plenty of ſpirituall gifts; but now ſuch is the Churches poverty, by reaſon of mens corruptions and Gods juſt judgements, that having loſt that true and pure grain with which at firſt Chriſtians were fed, we are at this day reduced to husks, of the diſpenſing of which this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Night-bird doth now brag much more, then they did of their pure corne: he deſerves the title rather of a <hi>ſwineherd</hi> then of a <hi>ſhopherd,</hi> and fitter for a hogs-ſty then for a ſheeps-coat. He truly that will ſeriouſly weigh the matter, ſhall confeſſe with me, that no otherwiſe then among Papiſts, deſpair makes a Monk: for many at this day, for fear of poverty, and out of a deſire to raiſe their fortunes, apply themſelves to Divinity as to ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall trade; neither have they any other intention more ſpiritual then to enjoy a fat Benefice, and may be freed from the ſtink of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical ſweat, and fear of ſtarving. Preſently aſpiring higher, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves, under pretence of ſanctity, into rich mens houſes, and ſo ſtuffe themſelves with worldly wealth; more wary then Chriſt, who did not allow ſo much as one bag to the Apoſtles his ambaſſadors, but theſe arm themſelves againſt poverty both with publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate bags. The hope of which good fortune ariſing from the Calling of the Church, or Impoſition of hands, its no wonder that they place in them a ſpirituall power, which ſo ſuddenly change their fortune: But it is plain to them that will look into this more narrowly, that the whole force and ſap of Eccleſiaſtick dignity floweth from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; for except from them the Treaſurer receive a command to pay them their Stipend, ſcarce would any Vocation or Conſecration
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114151:101"/>of the Church move ſo effectually the Eccleſiaſtick ſpirit, but it would be eaſily ſtopped and choked as it were with the ſilver quinſey. I will inſtance the truth of this by one example of the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> which was here told us. The Senate of <hi>Middleburg</hi> had reſolved ſome years ago, to pacifie thoſe ſuperlatively ſpirituall Bees, at that time making a ſtrange tumult within the hive, with a ſilver or money-medicine, (in which <hi>Marnixius</hi> ſaith, Church-bees take wonderfull delight) giving order to the Treaſurer to beſtow on each Miniſter of their City 100 Florens for an extraordinary gratuity. This bounty comming ſo unlooked for, did exceedingly pleaſe them, hoping it would prove annuall or hereditary; but theſe Governours of the City had made an expreſſe law, That no reward or benefit ſhould be beſtowed out of the publike ſtock upon any man for his life, or for ever, but upon condition of recalling it, if it ſtood with the publike good. Yet there is no certain or perpetuall poſſeſſion there of any gift which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the Town-bounty; but whoſoever enjoys any ſuch benefit, he is bound yearly to petition for the continuation thereof; which if out of pride or careleſneſſe it be neglected, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> the benefit ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and another may beg it. This law was prudently made; for by long experience it was obſerved, that theſe perpetuall poſſeſſions of offices or benefits in ſubjects cauſed pride and careleſneſſe, ſo that they ſeemed to deſpiſe their benefactors.</p>
               <p>This law then not being obſerved, and the neceſſity of burthens comming on, occaſioned a ceſſation of this benefit in Miniſters. There the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> (as if he had been fed with garlick) and his underlings, ſent meſſengers to the Magiſtrates to ſollicite them; then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to check them, and in their pulpits at laſt, yea in the ſtreets and high-wayes, and in every houſe and conventicle, to rage and raile, and revile them, as wicked Atheiſts and enemies to Religion, and ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly went about to overthrow all Divine worſhip, by withdrawing food from the Miniſters, and in muzling the mouth of the Oxen that tread out their corn, laſtly plotting all means to cauſe ſedition: But the Magiſtrate being nothing moved at all this, their ſpirituall pride and anger at laſt grew cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and all their froth vaniſhed into the air. If this be true, (which I will not aſſever) it ſhewes that the principall foundation of Eccleſiaſtick ſpirituality among the <hi>Walachrians,</hi> is not in the heart, or mouth, or in the head on which there was Impoſition of hands; but there where <hi>Judas</hi> his devotion lay, in the bag.

I am of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whom <hi>Sleiden</hi> writes, that being asked of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony,</hi> why there was ſo much trouble in the world at <hi>Luthers</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? anſwered, that <hi>Luther</hi> undertook a hard task; for he touched the Popes crown, and the Monks belly: ſhewing that the whole ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall heat of old popery conſiſted in the honour and pride of the Pope and great Biſhops, and in the belly or food of inferior Prieſts and Monks. And now let this my jeſting diſcourſe ſerve for a preface to what I am now to ſpeak in this laſt Tract, in which <hi>Apollonius</hi> hath opened all the boxes of ſubtleties, that he might make a formall and ſpecificall diſtinction between Eccleſiaſtick and Secular officers, or (as he ſpeaks) between the <hi>Eccleſiastick and Secular power,</hi> which he ſo divides, that he placeth this as a ſtar in heaven, but the other on the ground; which two he thinks can no more be united then heaven and earth; ſo that ſecular men, as ſecular, can no more meddle with Church-buſineſſe, then one ſtanding upon the ground can touch the heaven. Thus like an Exorciſt he makes a circle <hi>(of Eccleſiaſtick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, and of internall externals)</hi> as he ſpeaks, within which if any Lay-man offer to ſet his foot, he ſhall be preſently ſmitten with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziahs</hi> leproſie, or vexed with a devil. Upbraiding the Magiſtrate, if he venture to break in upon the preaching, cenſuring, legiſlative, &amp; chiefly Sacramentary buſines, that he is <hi>Simoniacall, wicked, a Tyrant, a tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler upon the right and laws of Chriſt, a violator of Chriſts ſpouſe, yea a trampler on Chriſts blood, laſtly a Monſter, and a Secular Antichriſt.</hi> Theſe he every where ſets down as orthodoxall, Dictator-like, and therefore ſaith that <hi>Musculus, Macovius, Vedelius,</hi> and ſo many as diſagree from him, <hi>contradict ſound doctrine, have wide ſhooes, they cover their ſhame with figleaves as Adam, and that they ere the paraſites and flatterers of Magiſtrates; the poyſonable betrayers of the Churches rights and liberties.</hi> So that no ſtable can be fuller of dung, then this work is of <hi>Apollonian</hi> flowres of railings againſt godly Magiſtrates, the Fathers of their Country. And although (to ſpeak freely) theſe are childiſh toyes what he utters here with ſuch eagerneſſe, yet I will gather together in a heap all his fooliſh chantings upon this buſineſſe, that the Reader may ſee in an epitome all to be of no validity what he ſpues out here againſt Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his Arguments tends to this, That he may ſhew Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick functions to differ generically and totally from thoſe of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114151:102"/>ſecular power, becauſe they differ in the <hi>Author, end, object, meanes,

               <p>As for the Author he ſaith, that the <hi>ſecular power</hi> and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongs onely to the <hi>Kingdome of God as Creator,</hi> as though God (as Creator) only were the Author thereof, but the Eccleſiaſtick power to the Kingdome of the Mediator, and hath Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for its Author, and as he is exalted, becauſe it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt being exalted, gave gifts to the Church, ſome to be Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> but not <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Magiſtrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that I wonder at the mans drunkenneſſe, who ſeekes for diverſity in things well compared: For, what matter is it whether God as Creator, or as Mediator, do appoint or command any thing? If this mincing of Divinity into ſmall parcels be admitted, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fooleries will ariſe. But I have hitherto anſwered principally, that all ſecular Magiſtrates have been inſtituted in the New Teſtament by Chriſt as Mediator, and exalted, and there are dayly ſuch. For I will aske whether he thinks not that <hi>Paul</hi> by the gifts and command of Chriſt the Mediator, did affirme the ſecular power which carrieth the ſword, to be eſteemed for <hi>Gods Vicegerent,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and every ſoule to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it?</hi> except he will ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this by the command of God the Creator, not the Mediator: it followes neceſſarily that the ſecular Power and Government in that place is eſtabliſhed by Chriſt the Mediator, as <hi>Paul</hi> his divine Embaſſadour affirmes: So that now no doubt is to be made, whether Chriſt as Mediator and exalted hath ordained the ſecular Power. For, it is expreſly ſaid by <hi>Paul, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver power there is it is, ordained of God; and he that reſiſts it reſiſteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> But that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> may not thinke that by God here is meant the Creator, let him remember that I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that Chriſt the Mediator after his exaltation hath received the full power of reigning, and therefore of ordaining upon earth: For, as Mediator, he hath received of his Father all power depoſited by him, till the conſummation of the world, which then he ſhall give up againe to the Father; whence I conclude, that now there is no ſecular Prince who hath not his Authority from Chriſt the Mediator, becauſe he alone in heaven, earth and under the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth, reigneth and triumpheth, whence the firſt difference taken from the Author falls.</p>
               <p>The other he placeth in the end, for thus he writes, <hi>As for the ends
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114151:103"/>of theſe powers God hath placed apart the ſecular power in order to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things,
<note place="margin">Fine par. 1 p. 62, 61, &amp;c. p. 51. p. 58.</note> and Eccleſiaſtick apart to ſupernaturall, ſo that both cannot extend themſelves to theſe things alone which are are of another order:</hi> And becauſe <hi>Vedelius</hi> ſaid that the Civill Magiſtrate had for its chiefe end the eternall ſalvation of the people, he anſwers boldly, <hi>but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that is ſpoken of the proximate and immediate end which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate by himſelfe in the force and power of his office aimes at or cares for;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 52.</note> and elſewhere more plainely, <hi>ſo wee muſt confeſſe in Chriſtian Common-wealths, that the Civill Power doth not touch nor can by it ſelf, or of its owne nature doe any thing towards the attaining of eternall bliſſe, except we will be Pelagians.</hi> Becauſe this ſaying is moſt abſurd and monſtrous, therefore I was willing that the Reader might ſee it in the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> owne words, the impiety and falſity of which I will now briefly touch.</p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerve the madneſſe of this brawler in calling it Pelagianiſm, if the Magiſtrate by the nature of his Civill function ſhould touch or meddle with the affaires of moderne Church Diſcipline, it ſeemes he is ignorant, what was <hi>Pelagius</hi> his opinion; <hi>Pelagius</hi> thought that a naturall man without grace could attaine to true faith; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is as falſe as if one ſhould ſay, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> being halfe rotten could riſe by himſelfe, though Chriſt had not called him. Wherefore this opinion hath been juſtly rejected, but what is this to the queſtion now in hand? Firſt, he ſhewes his mad malice againſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, becauſe he conſiders them in reſpect of their office of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrateſhip, and as ſecular men, as in the ſtate of nature, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which is <hi>to be blind in their minds, perverſe in their wills, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and ſons of wrath,</hi> ſo the Scripture ſpeakes of a naturall man, of whoſe power <hi>Pelagius</hi> diſputed. Is not this to blaſpheme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates and to curſe the Rulers of the people? To make them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their holy office, which God himſelfe ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, men blind in their mind, perverſe in their will, the ſons of wrath, and of hell? Was there ever any Anabaptiſt that durſt ſo raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Magiſtrates as this night-bird doth?</p>
               <p>Another of his fictions is, that he equalls the externall works of moderne Church-Diſcipline, to the moſt holy, divine, and ſpirituall worke of true faith: For, true faith is a worke of that difficulty that none of the holieſt Apoſtles had any power to conferre it, much leſſe can a naturall man attaine to it; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>hee that plants and he that waters is nothing,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> but it is God that giveth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>the circumciſion of the heart is not in the letter, but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114151:103"/>in the ſpirit, true circumciſion is that whoſe praiſe is of God, not of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> ſo that they are mad indeed, who think with <hi>Pelagius</hi> that man by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can acquire true faith, or confer it, being the worke of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Now let the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> here ſee his owne perverſneſſe, who that he may deſpiſe the Magiſtrates compares them to a naturall man, and that he may extoll the affaires of his Church-Diſcipline among ignorant people, compares them to the moſt divine worke of faith, from which they are infinitely diſtant: For, no man can truly believe but he that is truly ſpirituall, holy, and the child of God. But the outward Church-Diſcipline as it is now, hath ſo little excellency in it, that <hi>Judas</hi> himſelfe a Devill, <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Deacon, falſe Apoſtles and innumerable wicked men could performe them with profit and praiſe. For, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that in his time all did not preach Chriſt ſincerely,
<note place="margin">Phil. 5.16.</note> but ſome for honour, ſome for profit, and yet he confeſſeth, that their preaching was fruitfull; it is then ſo farre that the Civill Magiſtrate (in reſpect of his ſecular power) ſhould be debarred as ſacrilegious from the outward Church-Diſcipline, that ſcarce can there be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Impoſtor ſo wicked, any Brawler ſo perverſe, any Stage-player ſo impudent, who may not (if he will diſſemble) performe theſe Church-buſineſſes, and ſometimes too have with applauſe performed them. We need not go farther then this <hi>Walachrian</hi> for an example, who will not have us doubt but he hath a long time performed theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall workes of Diſcipline and Doctrine with authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and yet we ſee he is an impudent blaſphemer of Magiſtrates, but this by the way.</p>
               <p>I principally anſwer, that he is a manifeſt corrupter of Scripture, and a blaſphemous falſifier in ſaying that ſecular Magiſtrates, as ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that is, in reſpect of their ſecular power, are ſo ordained by God, and reſtrained, that they onely can and ſhould meddle with carnall and ſecular things of this world, and by no meanes with ſpirituall, and ſuch as may of themſelves procure the peoples eternall ſalvation: which is both falſe and blaſphemous againſt Magiſtrates, and God himſelfe. This he learned not of the Apoſtles, but from the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders of Romiſh Babylon; they (as I have often ſaid) handle the Scripture irreverently, taking out of them what they will, and adding to them what they liſt: when it is ſaid to <hi>Peter, when thou art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confirme thy Brethren,</hi> they expound this, (by adding) thou <hi>Peter</hi> alone ſhouldſt confirm all thy Brethren, nor thou onely, but all the Biſhops of Rome alſo alone, who are thy ſucceſſors, ſhall have the ſame right to confirme all thy Brethren, that, is, to judge, ſpoile, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114151:104"/>pervert all Kings and Kingdomes of the world: In this phraſe ſpoke the old Romaniſts, which this new Papiſt hath finely learned of them; the Scripture ſpeakes ſimply, that the Magiſtrate or higher power is ordained by God to defend and maintaine publike peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> It ſaith alſo, we muſt obey for conſcience ſake, and that he is the rewarder of them that doe well, and that he bears the ſword to puniſh the evill doers, not diſcriminating whether it be ſecular, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick, good or evill, which is ſubject to this power. This <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrian</hi> night-bird willing to free himſelfe in his Church-buſineſſe from this power, he trumpets out with ſwelled cheeks, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Magiſtrates in his Word to worldly affaires onely, and that he containes them as ſuch within the buſineſſe of this life, and of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall tranquillity, yea that he hath ordained, that they muſt not meddle with the things of life eternall, nor aime at them, or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure them, becauſe it belongs not to them to bind the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Is not this to corrupt and wreſt the Scripture? That we may ſee what a monſtrous paradox this is, I will ſhew the abſurdities thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God ordained the Civill Magiſtrate for intent, and with this reſtriction, then it followes, that all Magiſtrates doe well in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſpiſing, and not procuring what belongs to Worſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for he that ſo performes his duty, as to follow the preſcript and order that God hath ſet downe, he performes his duty well, but the conſequence is blaſphemous and abſurd, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> opinion be right, then Magiſtrates are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe and reward when they lay aſide the care of Religion and are provident onely in the corporall things of this world, and profits of this life, ſuch as were the Gentiles, and wicked Emperours, and Kings, who had little or no care of Religion, theſe followed Gods Ordinance exactly, but this conſequence is impious and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> be in the right, then <hi>Joſua, Solomon, Joſias</hi> and all good Princes who were carefull to reſtore Religion, did evill, and deſerved puniſhment, becauſe they went beyond their office, and Gods command, which was, to forbeare medling with Religion, and to remaine within the affaires of this life; but the conſequent is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and blaſphemy, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> be in the right, then the order and power of the Magiſtrate is the moſt monſtrous thing in the world. God makes and ordaines <hi>all things for himſelfe, even the wicked for the evill day, all
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114151:104"/>are from God, by God, and to God,</hi> nor is there any thing which hath God for its author, that hath not for its chiefe and proper end Gods glory, which is no where more advanced then when true Religion is advanced. Whence I gather, that the Ordination of Magiſtrateſhip is moſt perverſe, becauſe God did expreſly ordain this, that it ſhould not meddle with Religion, but containe it ſelfe within the dunghills of the world; whence it will follow that Magiſtracy is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained for Gods glory: but the conſequent is blaſphemous, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If God hath ſhut up the Magiſtrate within this end and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, then he hath ſtrangely perverted his owne order, where ſo often he hath armed Kings and Princes, and hath commanded them that they ſhould meddle with his Worſhip and Religion: for this end he gave the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Book of the Law to <hi>Joſua,</hi> and he hath preſcribed and commanded many other, that leaving their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affaires, they ſhould be chiefly carefull about matters of worſhip and ſalvation, as we may ſee in one <hi>Solomon;</hi> all which God hath done againſt the firſt inſtitution and ordination of the politick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which inconſtancy to attribute to God is blaſphemy: Wee muſt then rather aſcribe giddineſſe to the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> who obtrudes ſo falſe an Ordinance of God to men, concerning the power and office of Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if it be Gods perpetuall Law, that the Magiſtrate (as ſuch) muſt not meddle with Religion by himſelfe and properly, then it is very abſurd, that in the Scripture ſo many contrary commands are found, ſuch as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>and now O Kings kiſſe the Son, &amp;c.</hi> Eſa. 40. <hi>Kings ſhall be nurſing Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Tim. 2.2. <hi>Paul bids us pray for wicked Kings, that under them we may live peaceably with honeſty and piety:</hi> whence it is apparent, that God is ſo farre from debarring Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates from the care of Religion and piety, that on the contrary he commands, and will have it their chiefe buſineſſe to promote Religion and his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Hence the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> willing to award this blow, brings out his ſatchell of diſtinctions, that with his canvaſſe ſmoke he may blind the Readers eyes; for firſt he ſaith, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſhew that the end of Magiſtracy is to look to the good of the Church, becauſe there hee ſpeakes of wicked Princes, who then intended no ſuch thing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, men doe not alwayes intend in their offices, the end preſcribed by God, yet on the contrary they often reſiſt, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is true, that they ſhould follow the end preſcribed by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114151:105"/>God, if they would doe well; this <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, to be tranquillity and piety, which thoſe wicked Princes then intended not, but they ſhould have intended: and Chriſtians ought to hope and pray that they would intend it. If the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> would underſtand the matter, let him look on himſelfe, he knowes that he ſeldome intends the ſalvation of mens ſoules in his Miniſtery, but rather maintenance, worldly honour, and revenge on all them whom he thinks doe not ſufficiently regard his ſanctity, ſuch are chiefly the Magiſtrates; yet I believe hee will have no man doubt but that the end and intent of his Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is properly the ſalvation of ſoules, let him ſay the ſame of the Civill power.</p>
               <p>At laſt he confeſſeth that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſhews the end of the Magiſtrate preſcribed by God, to be the promotion of piety: but leaſt he ſhould ſeem to yeeld any thing out of the Scripture to the Magiſtrate in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred affaires, he interpoſeth an army of diſtinctions; for hee ſaith, that this end is not <hi>immediate, proximate, proper, which it may by its ſelfe produce,</hi> but onely <hi>by accident by the Miniſters of</hi> the Church, <hi>and of piety,</hi> ſo that though the Scripture ſhould ſay a hundred times, that the end of Magiſtracy and the chiefe intent of the Magiſtrate is the care of Religion, and advancing of ſalvation, this will not a whit move the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> for he on the contrary will ſay, that he hath no right to theſe ſacred affaires, but he muſt continue in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, which is the care of peace and worldly good things, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation are an improper end, remote by accident, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which, he of himſelfe doth nothing, but to procure that it may be done by Chriſtians, eſpecially by Preachers, to wit, if he build faire Churches, beſtow large ſtipends upon Miniſters, get good bread and generous wine for the Lords Supper, the taſte whereof may warme the Preachers ſpirits, if they affoord good tables, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull feaſts, and invite oftentimes the Preachers thither, that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the gravitie of mechanicke ſobriety, their ſpirits may bee made fine and ſubtill, for pumping out the ſtarrie ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of their Church-Diſcipline: which things when they have fallen out heretofore according to his deſire. I doubt not but he hath oftentimes ſaid to himſelfe of his diſcipline, as the Pope once ſaid of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>How much honour and profit hath this fable of Chriſt brought us?</hi> How much honour and delights are conferred upon us by this fable of the wonderfull ſanctity of Church-Diſcipline? The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of the thing, and the manifeſt corruption of Scripture, have driven me againſt my will to break this jeſt upon the <hi>VValachrian</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114151:105"/>ſanctity of their Church-Diſcipline and Doctrine. I wiſh that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had abuſed this excellent place of <hi>Paul,</hi> with ſo many childiſh ſubterfuges, he had read <hi>Calvins</hi> Commentary upon this place, which for faſhions ſake he ſo much eſteems, that he calls him his <hi>Calvin:</hi> but here truly he rejects and neglects him as a ſtranger: for rarities ſake I will ſet downe here a few paſſages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If then any care either of the publike peace, or of piety, or of honeſty move us, let us remember that a care muſt be had of them (he meanes Magiſtrates) by whoſe Miniſtery ſo many excellent things come to us. If one ask whether we ſhould pray for Kings, by whom we reap no ſuch thing. I anſwer, that our wiſhes tend to this, that being ruled by Gods Spirit, they would begin to be Miniſters of thoſe good things which heretofore they have deprived us of, &amp;c. For this principle muſt be alwayes remembred</hi> (Stilt-walker <hi>pricke up your eares) that God hath ordained Magiſtrates as well for the preſervation of religion, as of publike peace and honeſty, no otherwiſe then the earth is ordained for procreation of food. Therefore as we praying for our daily bread, beſeech God that he would fructifie the earth with his bleſſing; ſo in thoſe former bounties we ought to looke upon the ordinary meanes, which he hath in his providence ſet up, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, let Princes and all Magiſtrates be warned here of their duty; for it is not ſufficient, if in rendring to every man his due, they ſuppreſſe all injuries, and cheriſh peace, except alſo they ſtudy to promote religion, and by honeſt diſcipline to compoſe mens manners. For</hi> David <hi>doth not exhort them in vaine to kiſſe the Sonne;
<note place="margin">Eſay 49.</note> nor doth</hi> Eſay <hi>in vaine call them nurſing fathers of the Church. Therefore let them not flatter themſelves, if they neglect to afford their help in maintaining divine worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As theſe paſſages are notable and godly, ſo they are diametrically oppoſite to this <hi>Walachrians</hi> fictions. So farre is he from denying the care of religion to belong to the Magiſtrate properly, proximately by it ſelfe (as the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> prates) that he rather ſhewes him to bee principally ordained by God, to take care of religion, and that not remotely, improperly, and by accident, but properly and by himſelfe; except this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt will perſwade us, that it belongs to the earth, improperly, remotely, and by accident to produce fruits; ſo that if we weigh this matter with an even hand, we ſhall finde that <hi>Calvin</hi> aſcribes more, and greater parts to the Magiſtrate, in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting religion and ſalvation, then to the Miniſters themſelves.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> For theſe are onely conſidered as husbandmen, and ſowers of the ſeed, but the Magiſtrates as the earth. But as we know the earth is the more proper and neerer cauſe of corne, which receiveth the ſeed into its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114151:106"/>ſome, and ripens it, then the husbandmen, who reſt after they have ſowed, and removed what may hinder the growth thereof; even ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> either wrote unwiſely, or els he hath made the civill Magiſtrate the prime &amp; chief efficient cauſe of religion, &amp; procuring of ſalvation. I have been ſomwhat large about the end of the civill and Eccleſiaſtick power, that I might refell all the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> fooleries: he truly deales no otherwiſe with Magiſtrates, then <hi>Circe</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> did with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> his Fellows, whom though they were other ways prudent men, yet ſhe is ſaid to have changed them, with her ſinging and rod, into hogs, ſo that they could not lift up towards heaven their briſsly necks; and this ſhe did to make them her ſlaves. Even ſo this <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> that he might reigne alone in his Eccleſiaſtick Kingdome, by his preaching rod indeavours to make beaſts of Magiſtrates, that they may believe, the care of heaven and ſalvation belongs nothing to them, but that it exceeds their capacity: and that they have abundantly diſcharged their office, if they have thought onely, with <hi>Martha,</hi> of corporall, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and culinarie things; and, like hogs, wallow perpetually in things fading, and onely fit for the belly, leaving high and heavenly matters to Church-men.</p>

Now I hold this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Rat in a precipice, for either he ought to ſay that Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed corporall and not ſpirituall meanes, and conſequently evill in building of the Church, which is blaſphemie, or elſe that thoſe externall and corporall meanes of the ſword may be ſpirituall and eccleſiaſtick, which he hath now denied; there is no chinck then left to eſcape thorough, except what the Pope affords him.</p>
               <p>He uſeth priſon, ſword, armes, poyſon, and all carnall meanes, yet he denieth them to be carnall, but ſpirituall, becauſe they are uſed by him who is moſt ſpirituall; which though it be meer mockery, yet being armed with main power, he ſo aws men that they dare not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper againſt him; if this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt had equall power with the Pope, though being guilty of ſo much wickedneſſe doth now execrate and feare this carnall ſword of the Magiſtrate, he would in a ſhort time make uſe of priſons, tortures whips, and the ſword, to fulfill his own minde, which notwithſtanding he would quickly honour with the name of ſpirituality, becauſe he that uſeth them is Eccleſiaſtick and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and that againſt eccleſiaſtick men and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Before I leave the firſt member, I will adde this alſo, that all the meanes which the Magiſtrate uſeth are not whips, tortures, and ſwords: he oftentimes uſeth lawes, admonitions, reprooffs, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which we doubt not but the <hi>Stilt-Walker</hi> hath felt ſometimes, by reaſon of his turbulent ſpirit, which experience ſheweth is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of ſuch force, that thoſe whom Church-men by a hundred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooffs could not curb and reforme, the Magiſtrate by one check hath amended; ſo now it is apparent that <hi>Apollonius</hi> is every way malicious and injurious againſt his Magiſtrates, in calling the meanes, which they uſe contemptuouſly, corporall, externall, carnall.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee the eccleſiaſtick means, he bragges every where that they are meerly ſpirituall; but he lies egregiouſly, for we have ſeene Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the moſt divine builders of the Church, to have uſed lawfully many corporall meanes, for though it be certaine that they uſed ſpirituall meanes for building of the Church, yet they did not take them ſo preciſely, that all muſt be ſpiritual, nothing corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which they may uſe, for they uſed common water to baptiſe, bread and wine in the Supper, oyle to annoint, and many other things, which are corporall and naturall, to which notwithſtanding were added a ſpirituality, and relative ſanctitie from the uſe, the <hi>Stilt-Walker</hi>

<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> but hath been long. By the Propheteſſes <hi>Anna, Mary,</hi> and others, it appears, that God hath not altogether debarred women from Church-affairs, as this trifler perſwades; but when hee ſaith that Gentiles and wicked men, could perform civill offices well hee ſaith nothing; for in the end of the world <hi>many ſhall ſay, have wee not propheſied in thy name,</hi> and yet Chriſt will ſay to them, <hi>I know you not, Apollonius</hi> knowes that there are many preachers who are impious and hypocrites, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee keeps not off from Eccleſiaſtick functions, why then ſhould Magiſtrates, be kept off? he hath much more ſuch ſtuffe, which I paſſe by, as being of no validity.</p>
               <p>His chiefe and moſt beautifull argument, which hee often delights in is this: Eccleſiaſtick power and government is heavenly, becauſe it is called the Kingdome of Heaven, it is not of this world,

Firſt, I deny that viſible Churches are the Kingdome of Heaven; for then the Church of <hi>Middleburg,</hi> ſhould be Heaven
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114151:109"/>indeed, which is Falſe, as may appeare by this marke, in that Chriſt ſaith men doe not marry, nor give in marriage, in that Kingdome: but in that <hi>Apollonian</hi> heaven of <hi>Middleburg</hi> there are marriages daily. I confeſſe that in the viſible Church, men are inſtructed and taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdome of heaven, that at length they may obtain it, which buſineſſe <hi>(metonymically)</hi> is called the Kingdome of Heaven: but to conclude thence that the viſible Church is properly the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, or that the things thereof are heavenly, is two child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and repugnant to ſenſe: then certainly the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Church, ſhould be very heavenly, whom yet by theſe his patched peeces wee ſee to bee very earthly; ſo that the leproſie of the earth, ſticks not only cloſe to him, but is alſo very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to moſt Kings of this heaven; that if that heavenly Kingdome were not contained within compaſſe by the civill earthly Kingdome, thoſe Heavenly Kings would quickly deſtroy one another, ſo that I may truly ſay, that the earthly Kingdome ſuſtaines that heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or elſe it would fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Another fraud of his is in the other place, where Chriſt ſaith, my Kingdome is not of this world, Chriſt was asked by <hi>Pilate,</hi> if he were a King? he confeſſeth that hee was a King, but not of this world, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hee would not exerciſe his Kingdome in this world, hee addes a reaſon, if my Kingdome were ſuch, <hi>my ſouldiers would fight for mee,</hi> whence it appeares, that Chriſt ſpoke plainly, becauſe hee ſaid that he had ſuch a Kingdome, which hee did not exerciſe upon the earth, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and properly hee did not, but in Heaven when hee ſat down at Gods right hand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> thinks that by this Kingdome of Chriſt is to be underſtood the government of the viſible Church, which if true then Chriſt had anſwered <hi>Pilate</hi> intricately and captiouſly, becauſe ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, Chriſts Kingdom had been properly in the world, and a part of the world, yea in this Kingdome hee had his ſouldiers, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time he got more: for Kings and Emperours were made the defenders of this Kingdome and Church of Chriſt, although then I ſhould yeeld, that in ſome reſpect, the title of Chriſts Kingdome and of Heaven belong to the viſible Church, yet it were abſurd in this place ſo to take it; whereas it is here abſolutely denied; that this Kingdome is of this world; but the viſible Church, chiefely that which the <hi>Walachrian</hi> deviſeth, is in the world, and of the world, and is too full of worldly corruptions.</p>
               <p>And there is no leſſe fraud in corrupting that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114151:109"/>hee prepoſterouſly cites with the Pontificians; <hi>no man warring to God, doth intangle himſelfe with ſecular cares,</hi> the words properly ſound thus, <hi>no man that warreth, intangles himſelfe with the affaires of this life, that hee may pleaſe his Generall:</hi> in which words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle compares, to ſouldiers, the Preachers of the Word, and alſo what hee ſaith that <hi>Elders who labour in the Word</hi> which conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Miniſtery of the Word, ought not to intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the affaires of this life, to wit, in merchandizing, husbandry, and ſuch like, ſo that they intangle themſelves, and bee ſo carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the buſineſſe and ſweetneſſe of them, as with <hi>Demas,</hi> to forſake their ſtation for the love of this preſent world. This is the plaine ſenſe of that place in <hi>Paul,</hi> how perverſly it is corrupted, I will now ſhew; out of this place hee concludes, that it is altogether unlawfull and unſeemly, for a Miniſter of the Word to care for the affaires of this world, or any way to meddle with them; which not only is repugnant to Scripture; but is alſo a meer Popiſh fiction: <hi>Paul</hi> indeed would not have preachers intangle themſelves, that is, altogether involve themſelves in ſecular buſineſſe, but not to touch them at all, or totally to forbeare them, hee commands no where. Yet the practiſe of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles ſhew the contrary; for I will ask whether fiſhing, be a ſecular work of this life? I think no man will deny it; but the Apoſtles, for the three yeares together, that they were Chriſts diſciples, did ſtill exerciſe their fiſhing, yea they went to fiſhing after Chriſts Reſurrection: and who knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not fiſh after the Holy Ghoſt was ſent? truly <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after hee had long exerciſed his Apoſtleſhip, at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whilſt hee was a preacher with <hi>Aquila,</hi> hee exerciſed his mechanicall trade of making tents. If <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood his law, as this <hi>Walachrian</hi> wreſts it, then hee was a manifeſt breaker of his own law; therefore it is a Popiſh fiction, which this new Papiſt hath borrowed from the old ones; when hee interprets theſe words ſo as if it were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for preachers to meddle with ſecular buſineſſe: this error in length of time hath made Preachers idle, and dainty, yea it occaſioned Antichriſt; for rich Chriſtians conſidering with themſelves, that the taske of preaching was a difficult buſineſſe, and required a whole man, by degrees they furniſhed them with ſo many things out of their own eſtates, that they would have them bee altogether free from the care of things neceſſary, belonging to their food or lively-hood. For which end they built Monaſtries and cloyſtures, and endowed them with great revenues, in which the preaching Monkes might live pleſantly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114151:110"/>and commodiouſly, being free from all cares, that ſo they might the more freely give themſelves to their ſtudies. This inſtitution at firſt though worldly, yet was not evill, but in proceſſe of time covetouſneſſe poſſeſſed the minds of the Clergy, that like ſpirituall harpyes they ſtill affected and craved for more, untill their covetouſneſſe grew to that height, that the Pope alone became richer then all the Kings of the earth: from which vice at laſt proceeded pride, then laſineſſe, and neglect of theologicall ſtudies, and laſtly all kinde of luxurie, ſo that theſe Monaſteries became brothell-houſes, and ſwine-ſtyes of <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites;</hi> all which ſprung up, out of the miſ-underſtanding of that place, which now the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> goeth about to wreſt againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for becauſe he thinks hee can by theſe delude ignorant people, by perſwading them that it is unlawfull and unſeemly for preachers to meddle with ſecular affaires, hence hee concludes, as in a round, that therefore it is unlawful for ſecular men to handle Church-matters: for hee faines them to bee hogges, only addicted to worldly things, and of this life; in which they are ſtill intangled: thus not only doth he injure godly Magiſtrates, but impudently patroniſeth his Eccleſiaſticks; for as it is known that many godly Magiſtrates have been very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate both in mannaging of ſecular affaires, and alſo matters belonging to Religion very zealous, ſo experience teacheth, that not a few prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers having neglected and contemned their duty in preaching have been ſo intangled with worldly buſineſſe, that as at this day it muſt not offend Chriſtian eares, if ſome preachers, having broke their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates with Merchandizing and taking up money upon uſe, have cheared godly Chriſtians by turning bankerupts; which ſhewes that this <hi>Walachrian</hi> is an impudent <hi>vermine,</hi> who under pretence of avoiding ſecular affaires, puts ſo great a difference between Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrates and Church-Men, ſeeing he is convicted by theſe <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian</hi> examples and his own conſcience, that there is nothing which buſie Church-men more affect, then the affaires of this world.</p>
               <p>Like to this is another, which he is alwayes prating of <hi>The civill Power is Monarchicall, the Eccleſiaſticall ſhould be alwayes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocratical:</hi> ergo Civ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Magiſtrates cannot rule the Church. This argument alſo is made up of divers lies, for it is falſe that the Civill Government is alwayes Monarchicall, the Government of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is Ariſtocraticall; ſuch alſo is that of the Venetians, Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and others: another lye is, that the Church-Government is alwayes Ariſtocraticall, becauſe under <hi>Heli, Samuel, Macchabees,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:114151:110"/>and others; it was Monarchicall: yea in the New Teſtament it was not ſtill Ariſtocratical, but oftentimes Monarchicall. For I ask, when Chriſt lived upon the earth, and ruled the Church, whether the Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was not then Monarchicall? Doubtleſſe it was, if ever it was. Again, when <hi>Paul</hi> alone was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in <hi>Syria,</hi> was not then the government of that Church Monarchicall? For who was to be compared with ſo great an Apoſtle? Laſtly, when <hi>John</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was alone in the world, (for he lived longeſt) had not then the Church on earth a notable Monarch? Surely, if ſuch a Doctor at this day could be found in the world, he ſhould be as it were the Monarch of the Church, and worthy to whom the whole Chriſtian world ſhould riſe and give honour.</p>
               <p>Whence the Pope makes no bad conſequence, in calling himſelf the head and Monarch of the whole Church, and not Kings and Princes; becauſe they riſe and give honour to him: if it be true what he brags, that hee is Peters ſucceſſor, and endowed with the gifts of infallibility, as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> But becauſe experience teacheth, that he wants all <hi>Peters</hi> gifts, chiefly that of infallibility; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be nothing els but a monſter, and load of all vices: hence it is, that he is a meere Impoſtor, and a mocker of Chriſtianity; and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are miſerably deluded, in yeelding ſo much to ſo unworthy and wicked a man. All then that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> babbles for Oracles, are meere lies. But this I will add, that though Chriſt and his Apoſtles were by right Monarchs of the Church, yet they ſtill ruled the Church with that moderation, that their government ſeemed rather Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, then monarchicall; ſo that hence it appeares, there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that he ſhould alwayes rule monarchically, who hath the right of Monarchie; for he may uſe it ariſtocratically. If this be true of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks, why ſhould it not alſo hold in civill Princes, that though they be Monarchs, yet they may handle Church-matters in an Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call way, as oftentimes Kings do. And ſo the Kingdome of the Church ſhall not be monarchicall, though a Monarch live in it, ruling Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratically.</p>
               <p>He aſcribes much ſtrength to this Ram, which he is ſtill ſhewing, as if it had exceeding great Hornes; whereas indeed it is a horn-leſſe calfe: <hi>The power formally Eccleſiaſtick depends immediately from Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, the Churches husband, who gave Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers,
<note place="margin">par. 1. p. 37.</note> and Paſtors to his Church; but not Magiſtrates,</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>And hath placed this power in the Church,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>But Magiſtrates are not the Church: whence he gathers, that the Magiſtrates office is neither requiſite nor belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114151:111"/>to the Church,</hi> and conſequently <hi>that it appertaineth no wayes to them to uſe the Churches power.</hi> He parted this one Argument into divers; I have gathered his fooleries together in one bundle, that I may fling them downe together.</p>
               <p>Firſt wee muſt note, that this is an old, and oftentimes refuted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his, in perſwading us that Eccleſiaſtick power hath for its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Chriſt the Mediator and Spouſe of his Church, but not the Civill Power, I have ſhewed before, and now will more at large demonſtrate, that this is a moſt notorious lye.</p>
               <p>His principall Argument is,
<note place="margin">par. 1. p 37</note> that while Chriſt lived on the earth, he did all Church functions either by himſelfe, or by his Apoſtles; but did not meddle with the Magiſtrates office, but refuſed it, and prohibited it to his Apoſtles: whence Anabaptiſt-like he concludes, that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie hath neither Chriſt for its Author, not belongs to the Church: all which are a meere heape of lyes.</p>
               <p>For firſt I aske, whence learned he that no Function is required for the Church till the end of the world, but what Chriſt muſt diſcharge, either by himſelfe, or by his Diſciples living upon the earth? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith no ſuch thing, but is the meere fiction of <hi>Apollonius:</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let him tell me, when did Chriſt or his Apoſtles performe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centors part in the Church? becauſe <hi>Martyr</hi> doubts whether in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Church, there was any uſe of publique ſinging, which wee bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed at beſt from the Jewiſh Church: many offices ceaſed in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon the Apoſtles departure, to ſupply which, Neceſſity hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together many things, &amp; mans induſtry hath found out without any ſin, or blemiſh, if Antichriſt had not corrupted all with multitudes.</p>
               <p>His other lye is that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not here diſcharge the Magiſtrates office; that Fiction I have already refelled: for they uſed a co-active externall power, equivalent to the ſword. Chriſt with a whip purged the Temple;
<note place="margin">Mat. 21. John 8.</note> he ſuffered the judgement concerning the Adultereſſe to be referred to him; with his word he caſt to the ground the Souldiers that came to apprehend him, and chiefly when on the day of Palms, ſitting upon an Aſſe he rid to Jeruſalem in a Princely but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pompe, ſuffering the acclamations of the People, and their garments to be ſpread in his way,
<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> as if he had been a King; which is ſo manifeſt, that <hi>Mathew</hi> adds <hi>Zacharies</hi> Propheſie to be fulfilled, <hi>Behold thy King cometh to thee, meeke, &amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtles inflicted in the Church cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, as death, blindnes, &amp;c. All which evince, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they deſpiſed and avoided the pride and earthly pompe of Civill government, yet the office it ſelfe they diſcharged in the Church when neceſſity required.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:114151:111"/>
               <p>But (ſaith he) Chriſt being exalted, gave to the Church, gifts and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices neceſſary for it, among which the office of the Magiſtrate is not mentioned, whence he concludes, that this is not requiſite fore difying of the Church. I anſwer, among theſe offices mention is made of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and of Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. which <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Aretius</hi> on thoſe places ſhew to have been cenſures of life and manners, ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magiſtrates office. Laſtly, ſuppoſe that in thoſe places no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of Magiſtracie, did he therefore not ordain it? Yea <hi>Peter</hi> did plainly inſtitute this, and chiefly <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. as I have at large ſhewed before; neither needs he tell us that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gave theſe offices by himſelfe, but Magiſtracie he commended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Apoſtles; this is but a frivolous cavill, for he ſent the Apoſtles onely immediately, then the Apoſtles inſtituted the other functions, and after them <hi>Timothy, Titus</hi> and others: whence it appeares, that Chriſt the Mediator being exalted, is no leſſe the author of Magiſtracy, then of Church offices; becauſe that by a moſt famous Elogy of the ſame Apoſtle is ratifyed in the name and authority of Chriſt exalted, by whoſe government alone, now all things in heaven, earth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth are ordained and ruled, as I have often ſhewed.</p>
               <p>He objects that theſe offices and gifts were given to the Church, but not Magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that theſe were given indeed to the Church, or in the Church, as it is ſaid, 1 Cor. 12. but Epheſ. 4. the Apoſtle ſayth, that they were given <hi>to men,</hi> uſing a generall word. ſo <hi>Paul</hi> gave and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to the whole world the office of Magiſtracy, but under them alſo to the Church: becauſe he makes him to have the charge of every ſoul, except he will ſay that Churchmen want foules: whence it followes, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath alſo ſubjected the Church to the Civill powers, ſo that ſhe muſt be by them defended in good things, and puniſhed in evill. What wiſe man then will deny that Chriſt hath inſtituted Magiſtracy, and hath not given it to the Church? when as he by <hi>Paul</hi> hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Magiſtrate for his alone Legat upon earth, to whom alone he will have all ſoules be ſubject, and therefore Eccleſiaſticks alſo, and that for conſcience ſake; by whoſe ſword and authority he will have the Church defended in good things: all theſe are ſo cleare in this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> and in other Scriptures, that by no meanes can they be darkened.</p>
               <p>I know this Divinity doth not pleaſe the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> who is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with papiſticall furie, that the Magiſtrates office is not Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, that is, neceſſary for the edification and conſervation of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114151:112"/>Church; yet he rather placeth this office without the Church, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or in it,
<note place="margin">par. 1. p. 24.</note> becauſe that phraſe is too ambiguous to him, and repugnant to Divine right; and therefore placeth the Magiſtrates office onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, or Churchmen; ſo that he ſpeakes no other wayes of Magiſtrates then <hi>Heccius</hi> and other <hi>Cornuted Aſſes</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> who comming to the Conference at <hi>Wormes,</hi> was not preſently admitted into the full Aſſembly, where the whole Quire was of holy Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but was lead firſt apart into a private cloſet, which theſe <hi>Cornuted Beaſts</hi> ſaid was well done, and according to Scripture: for it is written, <hi>Without ſhall be Dogs and Witches.</hi> Not much more reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth this <hi>Walachrian</hi> prate of godly Magiſtrates, whom every where he faſteneth to the cares of this world, as carnall men, but elevates the Church, and Churchmen above the world, even to the Skies; but theſe are meere chimera's: the Scripture on the other ſide doth ſo extoll Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, as a thing perpetuall in the Church, and ſo neceſſary, that it cannot be parted from her; and without this ſhee cannot ſubſiſt, but muſt wither; no otherwiſe then corne that wants earth, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which I will ſhew hereafter more at large.</p>
               <p>He prates every where that the Church under the Apoſtles, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times wanted the civill Magiſtrate; but theſe are Lyes which I have already refuted, and will hereafter refute more: and if this impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould fall out, that the Church were totally deſtitute of civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet it ſhould not ceaſe to be an office in the Church, and as it were a part neceſſary for the conſtitution thereof: for as a body that hath loſt a foote, remaines yet without that foote but lame, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a neceſſary part: ſo the Church may conſiſt without Magiſtracy but not long, and that with much difficulty; for preſently there would ariſe Anarchy, and every one would do as he liſted; which becauſe <hi>Apollonius</hi> doth what he can to bring into his City, under hope of a new Popery: hence ariſe ſo many railing deviſes, by which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to hiſſe out the Magiſtrates, as meere worldly men, that they muſt not meddle with Church-buſineſſe, how ever the matter be, becauſe the Church hath often wanted godly Teachers, Sacraments, and other things requiſite for her; I might alſo as well inferre that theſe belong not to the Church, but are accidents circumjacent; which were moſt abſurd to the <hi>Stilt-walker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps he will object if this were true, then Chriſt had made the Churches power imperfect and lame, which muſt depend from an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward civill power; but this is repugnant with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>tell the Church,</hi> where he hath furniſhed her with full power.</p>

               <p>I anſwer: That all theſe are Jeſuiticall fictions which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for their Hierarchy, and which he hath borrowed from them; for firſt I deny when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> that he underſtood by theſe words, as if he had armed Church-men (being diſcriminated from Lay-men) with full power of exerciſing Government among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, excluding the Magiſtrate: For I ſaid before, that by the word <hi>Church</hi> is underſtood in Scripture, any kind of meeting, whether meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſtick, or Eccleſiaſtick and Civill, yea any tumultnary Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly called together to determine buſineſſe,
<note place="margin">Act. 19. Act. 15.</note> and oftentimes the whole body of the faithfull in oppoſition to their Rulers, ſomtimes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church with their Rulers, but never (for ought I know) the Rulers ſeparate from the body. Now here <hi>Apollonius</hi> muſt needs goe to conſult with the Delphick three-footed ſtool, that he may divine to us what Chriſt meant here by the Church, ſeeing he did not define it in this place, nor do we ſee it elſewhere explained in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> doubtleſſe with the Papiſts having a watchfull eye over his merchandiſe, rather underſtands it of the Church-Rulers; for this is all his care, that this wonderfull Eccleſiaſtick power, by many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings, being ſnatched from the body of the Church, and chiefly the Magiſtrate, may be ſetled onely in the Governours as in the Center, that is, in the Conſiſtory; and becauſe Deacons are onely poſitively Church-men, as bellowes in a paire of Organs, Elders onely comparatively, as the pipes which of themſelves ſound not: hence at laſt the whole power ends in Preachers ſuperlatively Eccleſiaſtick, as if they were Maſters of the muſick, and ſo ſing and play upon that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Organ, that every pipe ſhall yeeld no other ſound then what pleaſeth theſe Organiſts. Thus the old and new Papiſts doe play the Philoſophers upon this there, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> as if Chriſt had meant tell the Pope, or the Clergie, or the Preachers of the Goſpell, but of this never a word in <hi>Matthew;</hi> yea it is contrary, for Chriſt being ſo underſtood ſhould have named a Judge who was neither then, nor long after in the world: What an abſurdity had it been for Chriſt to have ſaid to the godly, that you may free your conſciences from ſtrife with your brother, go to the Conſiſtory, or Church-Rulers, which were not then, nor to be in many years after. Whence it is more likely that Chriſt by the Church meant there a Judge or Arbitrator in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies indefinitely, and (as I ſaid elſewhere) without any expreſſe quality; that is, ſuch a one as they could repaire to, whether conſiſting of Eccleſiaſticks and Civill Magiſtrates, as the <hi>Sanhedraham</hi> was then, or onely of Eccleſiaſticks as afterwards under the Apoſtles, or of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114151:113"/>Magiſtrates, as was in the Church after Magiſtrates became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, members, keepers, and nurſing fathers of the Church. Hence we ſee how much the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is deceived in thinking Magiſtrates to be excluded from Church-affaires in this place, becauſe of the word Church, ſeeing in the moſt ſignifications of this word Church, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is included onely one that excludes him which is not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, but is not plainely expreſſed by Chriſt; how vaine then is this his argument, wherein he ſo much prides himſelfe! Chriſt gave this power to the Church, but the Magiſtrate is not the Church, for if hee deludes us under the collective name of the Church, <hi>repreſented or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting,</hi> then we grant that the Magiſtrate is not the Church: but ſo neither is <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Church, except he will call himſelf the Pope; and ſo this power belongs no more to <hi>Apollonius</hi> then to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but if he ſpeak of the Church as it is indefinitely uſed by Chriſt, then he cannot make it appeare that Miniſters alone are more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under this word, then Magiſtrates alone, becauſe both are parts of the Church, and the Magiſtrate in reſpect of his judicatory power the more excellent part.</p>
               <p>The other error is, that out of theſe words <hi>tell the Church,</hi> the old Papiſts beat out by a ſtrange paraphraſe the whole building of the huge papall Hierarchie, as if they would ſhew that the Pope is Judge of all controverſies between Kings, the donor and diſtributer of Lands, the Monarch of all Monarchs, the infallible cenſurer and poler of all Nations, the diſpenſer of all wickedneſſe in others and in himſelfe: all this they think Chriſt eſtabliſhed in theſe words, <hi>tell the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> inſtructed in the ſame Catechiſme, out of theſe words <hi>tell the Church,</hi> doth almoſt draw out every thing, to wit that the Magiſtrates muſt not meddle with Church-matters, and that they are not within but about and without the Church, that they have no power of Vocation, making of Lawes, or deciſive cenſuring of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but that all theſe belong ſolely to Miniſters, who in this are free, and immediately depending on Chriſt and no way depending on the Magiſtrate, ſo that if they ſhould faile in their life and manners, yet the Magiſtrate if he be a pious ſon muſt not preſently riſe up againſt the Miniſter his Father, but he muſt firſt wink at his vices, and then (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſome few caſes) muſt not puniſh him, but onely he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that Church-men, as being ſpecially holy, puniſh the ſpecially ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter, which is as likely that theſe <hi>Walachrians</hi> will do, as if you ſhould make Elephants clear one another of their Leprofie. Theſe and much more doth he conclude out of theſe three words, <hi>tell the Church;</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:114151:113"/>but indeed this is to make a beame of a mote, I rather ſay, that Chriſt in this place ordained nothing elſe, but that a brother who is willing to be reconciled to his brother which is unwilling, ſhould and may (for ending the controverſie) implore the Churches help, and in this caſe the Church ought to help him. But what I pray, is this for grounding that huge Hierarchie of the Church, that ſhe muſt have abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conſecrating, excommunicating, commanding, and ſuch like? for, if the words following, <hi>if he heare not the Church let him be to thee as a Publican and Heathen,</hi> ordain the right of excommunication, then Chriſt beſtowes it not there on the Church, but on the brother who deſires to be reconciled: For, he doth not ſay, let the Church account or declare that brother for a Publican and Heathen, but let him be to thee a Publican and Heathen, &amp;c. that is, as a brother thou may eſteem him for a Publican, &amp;c. if this ſignifieth to excommunicate, then Chriſt gave the power of excommunication not to the Church, but to every private brother, that I wonder ſo proud a Divine ſhould ſo careleſly weigh his owne lawes, out of which he drawes ſo many priviledges.</p>
               <p>One lie more there reſts in this Argument to be ſhewed, in ſaying that Miniſters are immediately ſubject to Chriſt and depend from him: whence he concludes, that they are not ſubject to the Magiſtrate, but this is a meer fiction, for I will aske, how ſhall we know this, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read it in Scripture? he will ſay, that Chriſt is the immediate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Church power, becauſe he gave the keyes to the Church, he ſaid tell the Church, and he gave Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c. out of all which it is manifeſt, that the office, or (as he calls it) the Church power is immediately ordained by Chriſt. I confeſſe, this is truly ſaid of the Church functions, and it is no leſſe true of the civill power, which Chriſt the Mediator alſo immediatly eſtabliſhed, ſaying, <hi>give to Caeſar what is Caeſars, &amp; to God what is Gods,</hi> eſpecially when by <hi>Paul</hi> he hath declared Magiſtrates to be his Legates, and hath ſubjected to them the Miniſters for conſcience ſake, ſo that now the Civill power depends as well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt as the Eccleſiaſtick: But how will hee hence prove, that all who uſe this power, that is Miniſters and Preachers, are immediately ſubject to Chriſt, and depend from him? This is a Popiſh fiction and an old cheat, the falſhood whereof any may quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; for if all do immediately depend on Chriſt who diſcharge any office which Chriſt or God hath immediately ordained, then all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Fathers, Maſters, Deacons, Readers, and whoſoever exerciſe any function ordained by God, muſt depend on him immediately, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114151:114"/>therefore ſhall be under the command of none, in reſpect of that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but of God or Chriſt. Which fiction the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will finde in himſelfe; for if all Preachers be ſubject to none but to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their free Eccleſiaſtick power which they exerciſe, how will their dependencie conſiſt, and the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets? For, he confeſſeth, that the brothers are ſubject to the Conſiſtory, this to the Claſſis, the Claſſis to the Synod, and the leſſer Synod to the greater, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> I know <hi>Apollonius</hi> teacheth this onely <hi>pro forma,</hi> becauſe he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>that he is onely tied to the authority of the Synod as humane:</hi> But here I hold him faſt intangled in his owne gin, for either it is falſe, that Miniſters in regard of their Eccleſiaſtick functions are ſubject onely to Chriſt immediately, or elſe it is true, that the Conſiſtory, Claſſis, and Synods are nothing elſe but Chriſt himſelfe; but this laſt is blaſphemy; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the firſt is moſt falſe, it's truly ridiculous to ſay, that he is onely ſubject to Chriſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, who is ſubject to ſo many, of which none is Chriſt. So we ſee this <hi>Walachrian</hi> is carried every where with a Popiſh giddineſſe. Whence now I conclude, if it be no wayes againſt the immediate and fictitious dependencie of Preachers from Chriſt, that they are ſubject to ſo many Church-men, why ſhould this be a hindrance from being ſubject to the Civill Magiſtrate? he will ſay (I ſuppoſe) that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is of another court, to wit carnall and altogether abſurd, and inſociable, (for this is all his care, that he may free himſelfe from the power of the ſword which he doth exceedingly execrate) but I have ſhewed already that there is no ſuch difference or diſparitie between the Civill and Eccleſiaſtick power, but rather conjoyned by God, and ſo coupled, that the one cannot ſubſiſt without the other, but yet ſo as in marriage, the Eccleſiaſtick muſt be ſubject to the Civill, as the wife to the husband; for, the Apoſtle ſaith, that every ſoule muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Civill powers, and therefore the Church and Chriſtians who are ſoules, and to whom properly the Apoſtle wrote this command. But I finde no where that every ſoule muſt be ſubject to the Church-Rulers, for it were abſurd and againſt Gods Ordination, even as if the husband ſhould be forced to be ſubject to his wife: this was Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts invention, as <hi>John</hi> fore-told, who paints him out as a woman and a proud whore clothed in ſcarlet,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.17. &amp;c.</note> armed with a cup and inchanting wine, with which ſhe hath ſo bewitched Emperours and Monarchs, that ſhe hath ſubjected them like beaſts to her, and ſits upon them; which we truly ſee in the Pope, who is a Church, and indeed a woman and whore, with her ſuperſtitious deviſes of ſanctity hath ſo bewitched
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114151:114"/>Princes, that laying aſide their manly and husband-like ſtrength, like uxorious men, have given to the Pope and the Whore, all the ſtrength of their Dominions and government; but he like a <hi>Hecuba</hi> or imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman, hath compelled them not onely to kiſſe her Thumbe, but baſely her very feet too, a moſt monſtrous thing! which roſe from this, that they caſt off the care of Religion, and of Church buſines at home, the Magiſtrates committed them, as if they had nothing at all apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to them, to the Churchmen; no otherwiſe then if the husband ſhould commit the whole buſines of the Family to his wife; only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelfe with feeding of his own belly; or as the Hiſtorians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, like uxorious <hi>Ninus,</hi> who for three dayes onely gave to his wife <hi>Semiramis</hi> the command and government of his whole Kingdome; but what fell out? She preſently with rewards, delights, and diverſe cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wayes did ſo entice the Peeres of the Kingdome, that before the three dayes end, <hi>Ninus</hi> was murthered, and the whole Empire came to his Wife: ſo it fell out with thoſe uxorious halfe-men in ſpirituall things, as ſoon as Princes by their ſloth, neglect Gods worſhip and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or being affrighted from them, as not belonging to them, with childiſh feares, commit them to Eccleſiaſtick women, the purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth not continue long, and the Peace of the Civill State is alſo diſturbed, which is not onely true in the Popes Dominions, but alſo in ſome neighbouring Kingdomes of late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> his other demonſtrative argument followeth; the power of the Magiſtrate, ſaith he, is architectonicall, with command and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power; but the Eccleſiaſtick power is miniſteriall, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for it is ſaid Mat. 20. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles beare rule, it ſhall not be ſo with you; ergo,</hi> theſe two powers differ altogether, nor can they be mixed. In this Argument, if any where, he playeth the <hi>Juggler</hi> and <hi>Witch,</hi> as Poyſoners uſe to cover their venemous Medicaments or Pills with gold; ſo doth hee uſe the Scriptures: ſo the Devill uſed it, by depraving it, with a purpoſe to deceive Chriſt when hee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſets downe a true Maxime, that the Magiſtrates power is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonicall, which <hi>Paul</hi> confirmes, not onely Rom. 13. but hitherto no man hath queſtioned it, except the old Papiſts and the <hi>Walachrians</hi> agreeing with them: but that this matter may not lurke in obſcurity, I will in few words declare wherein this Architectonical power conſiſts. This power doth not require that he who poſſeſſeth it, ſhould or can do
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114151:115"/>all things by himſelfe; that he ſhould be exempted from all lawes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no counſell or reaſon; ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeakes injuriouſly of the civill Power, calling it deſpotical or domineering, which power ſhould be barbarous and tyrannicall: from this kind of reproaches our <hi>Stite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walker</hi> can ſcarce refraine himſelfe. But the Architectonicall power doth not require, that none ſhould be abſolutely ſubject to any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to God: For, ſo none ſhould have this power properly, except he that had all the Monarchs of the world in ſubjection to him; but there was never yet ſuch a Monarch on earth: whence <hi>Paul</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy well of Antichriſt,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> that ſuch ſhould his pride be, as that he ſhall exalt himſelfe <hi>above all that are called Gods or Monarchs.</hi> This we ſee in the Pope, who ſaith, that he is ſubject to none except to God alone, and that all Monarchs are ſubject to him: For, <hi>he obeyes none, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> This power indeed were chiefly Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctonicall, but it is ſeldome or never given; therefore the Architecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall or Supreame power commonly deſcribed conſiſteth in this, that one hath chiefe power within his owne precincts ſubject to none other; but on the contrary, all are ſubject to him, none excepted; ſo that there he alone can preſcribe, command, and compell with power to puniſh and force, if need be. Thus <hi>Pharoah</hi> deſcribes it, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him he beſtowes upon <hi>Joſeph</hi> Architectonicall power over all <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
<note place="margin">Gen. 41.44.</note> I am Pharoah, without thee no man ſhall lift up his hand or foot in the Land of Aegypt:</hi> he exempted him not from his owne power, nor did he free him from the law and juſtice, but (except himſelfe) he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all men and all things to him; ſo God deſcribes the ſupreame regall power, that it had right <hi>over their ſons and daughters, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and cattell,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> finally over the goods of their Subjects,</hi> not that hee could doe all that he pleaſed, (for in this he ſhould doe ill and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically) but that he had power according to the rules of juſtice, to take notice of all things, to order and put them in execution; for ſo the Lawyers ſay, that there is no Empire without Juriſdiction, no Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction without power of <hi>examining, judging, and executing,</hi> ſuch is the Architectonicall power, which if he underſtood well, and if hee wrote ſeriouſly, not ironically, he confeſſeth doth belong onely to Magiſtrates, as the title of his book, <hi>the Right of Majeſty,</hi> ſheweth: but he mocks Magiſtrates, as I will ſhew by and by.</p>
               <p>The other member of the antecedent is, that Church-men want altogether this Architectonicall power, and that therefore the whole
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114151:115"/>power Eccleſiaſtick ſhould hee Miniſteriall, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: which Maxime preciſely taken, is falſe, becauſe I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, when they ruled the Church, had an Architectonicall and ſupreme power, which they exerciſed in the Church ſometimes, but not with any externall pompe, nor alwayes. But it is objected, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>the Kings of the Nations beare rule, it ſhall not be ſo with you;</hi> for then they diſputed about precedency in Chriſts Kingdome, and Chriſt ſaid abſolutely to the Apoſtles that were to bee Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Church, <hi>you ſhould not reigne, but ſerve:</hi> whence hee gathers, that the whole government and power of the Church ſhould be <hi>without command,</hi> and rather with ſervice; theſe are the enthymems, which hee after a Jeſuiticall manner, hath patched together.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: That I cannot read in that place the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit that the whole power or government of the Church ſhould be without command, or Architectonicall power alwaies: For, if he ſay, that the whole power of the Church was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, to whom he ſpeaks here, he asks the thing in queſtion, or at leaſt ſuppoſeth it. For the chiefe part of Eccleſiaſticall power and government is alwaies (as I ſaid) in the Magiſtrate, and in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power; whence it fell out, that in the Apoſtles time this Architectonicall power reſided in Chriſt and his Apoſtles miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, becauſe the ordinary Magiſtrates were enemies. 2. I deny that this Law which he gave here to the Apoſtles was perpetuall, at leaſt, it cannot be ſhewed out of this place, that what Chriſt there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles, doth belong alwaies and to every Miniſter of the Church, this will be cleare by an example: When Chriſt ſent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, he ſaid to them, <hi>take not a ſtaffe, or bag, nor money, nor two coats, nor houſes</hi> would he allow them, but <hi>whatſoever houſe they came into, they ſhould abide there till they departed, &amp;c.</hi> all this he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Apoſtles that were to be Rulers in the Church, when hee ſent them to that purpoſe: For except one will allow the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monks, of Beggars, of naſtie Anchorites, which are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous among Papiſts, every one may ſee that theſe precepts are not perpetuall and common to all Preachers. This literall expoſition ſhould not be welcome (I think) to the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> and his <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrian</hi> Papiſts, to have never above one coat, to be without money
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114151:116"/>in their purſe, and to have neither a houſe of their owne nor hired, but hop to and fro, like locuſts: If ſo many Lawes ſo ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Apoſtles, the Church-Governours, are not perpetuall and neceſſarie to the Church. It will be a difficult thing out of the circumſtances of the place, to draw a juſt difference, by which it may appear that this Law is perpetuall and common to all Miniſters; which if he ſhould effect with his ruſty inſtruments, he will never make this to be true, that what was prohibited to the Apoſtles or Biſhops, was prohibited to the whole Church: For many abſurdities will ariſe, they may not meddle with ſecular affaires, nor wear rich, ſoft, and Court-garments, nor wander from place to place, nor bee abroad ſometimes in the Country about their buſineſſe. Muſt none of thoſe things be done by anie in the Church? They be fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous fictions which ariſe hence, in that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt thinkes that nothing is Eccleſiaſtick or belonging to the Form and Government of the Church, but what is concluded in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory or Quire of Preachers alone: the Scripture contrarily makes Kings and Magiſtrates the chiefe part of the Church, to wit tutors and nurſing fathers, and as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, as it were the earth in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall husbandrie; let me ſhew by a ſimile or two the ſtupiditie of this <hi>Walachrian,</hi> it is all one as if one reſolving to be a husband-man, provideth ſeed, horſes, and inſtruments fit for husbandry, have alſo Plowmen, Waterers and Planters in a readineſſe, and thinks that he is now perſectly furniſhed for husbandry, whereas he hath not Land or Fields to ſow his ſeed in, or play the husbandman upon: he doubtleſſe will bee laughed at as a foole, and one altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of agriculture.
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> I confeſſe that out of Chriſts Parable, all men are as the ground into which the ſeed is caſt: but this is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Calvins</hi> Simile; for private men are but little clods, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one another in the ground, on which the ſeed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls; but the Magiſtrate is conſidered as the generall ground, which if it did not containe all the clods together, they could not fructifie, but would fall away, and the ſeed wither in them. So fitly doth this Simile of <hi>Calvins</hi> expreſſe the Magiſtrates office in the Church, and the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> ſtupidity, who is ſtill ſtriving to thruſt the Magiſtrate out of the Church: I will uſe another Simile which <hi>Paul</hi> intimates,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> when he calls Preachers <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Rowers in the lower ſeat of the Church: whence he conſidereth the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114151:116"/>as a Ship. Now who will imagine a Ship in a tempeſtuous Sea, without a Maſter, or Mariner? Chriſts Church then muſt have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Steers-man. It is asked who this is? The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſayth, it is he and his Preachers, becauſe they are Captaines and Governours, and many other prating Speeches which I have heretofore refuted: I ſay that they are not even, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls them Rowers, and that of the loweſt ranke in this Ship: who ever ſaw in the Kingsſhip or Gally; that the naked Rowers and thoſe of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ranke, tyed to their Oares, ſhould have the command of the Ship?</p>
               <p>This ſtands not with reaſon, and experience; and if the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> did not perceive this abſurdity, the law of Chriſt would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him; for he as the Maſter of the Ship ſaid, you Rowers <hi>muſt not do ſo,</hi> that is, I will not have you to beare rule in my Ship. Hence then it appeares, that to whomſoever the government of the Ship belongs, it belongs not ordinarily to the Preachers, by the Princes own expreſſe will: now there remaines nothing but that this Ship of Chriſt either want a Maſter, or elſe ſome other muſt be ſought for beſides the Preachers, who cannot be her Maſters: the <hi>Walachrian</hi> to award this blow, ſaith, that there is no Maſter, which is the ſcope of his whole argument, that he may drive out of the Church archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonicall power, and may place it only <hi>about</hi> the Church: but the abſurdity of this will appeare out of this Simile; it is incongruous to imagine a great Ship in the vaſt Sea without a Maſter or Pilot: or to conceive ſuch a Maſter who is not within the Ships decks, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, flying about like a Coot, or Sea-mew. Theſe opinions of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> are chimaeras and monſters, the Maſter then ſhould be within the ſhip; and if this night-bird were not purpoſely mad, he would ſee that this can be no other then the Magiſtrate, becauſe he confeſſeth himſelf that the Magiſtrate is the head and father of the people. But if he ſhould again deny what hee hath granted, <hi>Paul</hi> would convince him, who makes the Magiſtrate the generall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of every ſoul, that is of this ſhip of Chriſts alſo. So that here al the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> falſe opinions tumble down together, towit, <hi>That the Architectonicall power ſhould be without the Church,</hi> that the Magiſtrates ſupream regiment cannot be within the Church; but that <hi>all the power and government of the Church belongs to the Preachers, as Captaines,</hi> for by this Simile all theſe vaniſh to nothing; ſurely if he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114151:117"/>had diligently weighed theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Kings heararule, but it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi> he would have found by them, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church belongs to Chriſt, for the Diſciples diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not ſimply for rule, but for rule in the Church: whence I collect that Chriſt gave to Kings and Magiſtrates rule over the Church, for what he denyed to the Apoſtles and Preachers, that he hath granted to Magiſtrates: for he ſaid <hi>Kings beare rule, it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi> but he denyeth to the Apoſtles rule over the Church, <hi>ergo,</hi> by the law of oppoſites he hath given and granted to magiſtrates rule over the Church: I will expect how the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will elude this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from Chriſts own words, it agrees ſurely with <hi>Calvins</hi> Paraphraſe upon this place, out of whoſe commentaries I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge theſe few paſſages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are deceived then, who extend this ſaying to all godly men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly; when notwithſtanding out of the thing it ſelfe Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Apoſtles were ridiculous, who diſputed for degrees of power and honour in their order, becauſe the office of preaching, to which they were appointed, hath no affinity with the Empires of the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſt hath ſet Paſtors ever the Church, not to command, but to ſerve. So the errour of the Anabaptiſts is refuted, who exterminate out of the Church Kings and Magiſtrates, becauſe Chriſt denieth them to be like his Diſciples; whereas the compariſon here is not between Chriſtians, and profane men, but between their offices: Beſides, Chriſt had not ſo much reference to the men, as to the condition of his Church: for it might be, that he who was Lord over a towne or village, upon neceſſity might be forced to undertake the office of teaching: but it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Chriſt to ſhew, what the Apoſtolicall function did import, and what it was not to meddle with.</hi> And a little after: <hi>I anſwer, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine every thing, Kings themſelves do not rightly governe, except they ſerve: yet in this the Apoſtleſhip differs from earthly principality, that Kings and Magiſtrates are not hindred by their ſervice from ruling, and with magnificent ſplendor and pomp to ſhew their eminency over their ſubjects; ſo</hi> David <hi>and others,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after: <hi>Chriſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the Apoſtles from the order of Kings; becauſe the condition of Kings is different from that of the Apoſtolicall function.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet one thing remaining concerning this argument to be touched, to wit, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> wrote this in jeſt not in earneſt, when he grants to the Magiſtrate ſupreme power, and denieth it to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114151:117"/>Church-men; he meant no ſuch thing: but in all this work he ſtrives to make Preachers ſupreme, and the Magiſtrates poore ſlaves; for of himſelfe and Preachers he ſaith every where, <hi>That Christs Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats depend immediatly from Chriſt the Mediator exalted,</hi> who have power to <hi>command with authority,</hi> who have ſelfe-ſufficient power <hi>under Chriſt, and that regall.</hi> Can any man have ſuch a power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he that is ſupreme?

                  </gap> the thing it ſelfe. What doth agree more with ſupreme power, then to be abſolutely free, and ſubject to none in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Common-wealth; ſo as that he may not be puniſhed, though he do evill, no not by the ſupreme power of that place: but ſuch doth he feigne all Preachers to be. <hi>Their calling ought to be free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, they ought alſo to uſe freely and abſolutey the preaching and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring keyes; it belongs onely to them to make and proclaime Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Lawes, and to force the diſobedient with puniſhment and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> And in all theſe, as being formally Eccleſiaſtick, he ſaith that the Eccleſiaſtick power of Preachers is ſo free, that it is an way lawfull for the Magiſtrate who is ſupreme, to meddle with them: For, if the Magiſtrate call, that is, (by his paraphraſe) <hi>confirme,</hi> if <hi>of himſelfe, and deciſively,</hi> he appoint Eccleſuſtick Lawes, if by himſelf, and by Eccleſiaſticks, <hi>he offer to puniſh Church-men,</hi> yea if hee dare take off any Church-penalties inflicted upon any man, or defend them who are thus oppreſſed, when they appeal to them, though the lawfulneſſe of the penalty be queſtioned: In all theſe caſes, he affirmes the Magiſtrate to be a tyrant, and a trampler upon the Church-priviledges, Chriſts ſpouſe, and which Chriſt bought with his blood. Yea, which is more,
<note place="margin">par. 1 p. 91 93, 94.</note> if the ſupreme Magiſtrate offer ſuch things, he ſaith, that the Church-men have power to puniſh him with excommunication: and that it is his duty, as being a ſheep of the Church, to ſubject himſelf and all his to the Miniſters. This is the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> hierarchicall divinity, which indeed makes of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſupreme Magiſtrates, and of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, a poore flave to Preachers. Neither ſhould the Magiſtrate permit <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to delude them, in ſaying, that his power is onely in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; and (as he ſpeaks) formally <hi>internalls,</hi> or <hi>externally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi> of the Church.

<note place="margin">par. 1. p. 9.</note> but that in ſome reſpest it belongs to the Ecaleſiaſtick Court.</hi> Whence it followes, that there is nothing in the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114151:118"/>in which the Magiſtrate can be free from the juriſdiction and cenſure of Church-men. Nor is this of any moment, which he ſaith, that the Church inflicteth no puniſhment but ſpirituall, and of excommunication almoſt, which belong not to the body: For, all theſe are meer mockeries, with which he would cover the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his intentions, for all Eccleſiaſtick penalties, chiefly the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian,</hi> have no other end, but directly to wound mens reputations, and ſo indirectly their eſtates and lives; for li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

By which arts not onely hath he freed himſelf from puniſhment of the ſecular power, (to which by divine right he is ſubject) but on the contrarie by his counterfeit humility and verball ſervice, he is flowne ſo high, that now he gives and takes away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires, and hath compelled the greateſt Monarchs of the earth like horſe-boyes, to hold his bridle and ſtirrups, yea to yeeld their necks as a ſtirrup for him to tread upon, and humbly to kiſſe his feet. Although the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> be many miles diſtant from this height, yet he is no leſſe tickled with the thought of the event thereof then <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> with hope of making gold; upon which though they waſte their eſtates till they turn beggars, yet they are ſtill affected with that imaginarie gain, the deſire whereof doth ſtill renew in them, and their minds grow ſick with curing of them; but enough of this argument.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:114151:118"/>
               <p>Hitherto he hath fought indirectly; now he flings his dart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly taken from the Leviticall worſhip. For he thinks it is moſt certain, that God in the Old Teſtament under the Levites made an inſociable rupture between the civil and eccleſiaſtick powers, which difference he thinks to be morall and perpetuall, and ought now to be religiouſly obſerved. I have divers times ſpoken of the vanity of this argument; now I will more particularly ſhew its abſurdities and falſhoods.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, it is falſe that God hath put a difference between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and Church-men properly; he made indeed a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Levites and other tribes, that whether they were ſecular or eccleſiaſtick, being not Levites, they were debarred from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Prieſthood: if on the contrary they were Levites, although they were ſecular, they were not kept off, as we ſee in <hi>Samuel, Eli,</hi> and others, in whom the ſecular and eccleſiaſtick government were united. I hope the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will not deny that the moſt divine Prophets were Church-men, and yet they could not ſacrifice nor perform Levitical functions, if they had not been Levites; for God choſe them out of all tribes. So that here we ſee the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> betakes himſelf again to his old trick of lying, in labouring to perſwade us that God had put a difference between all ſecular and eccleſiaſtick perſons, which is his fiction, whereas it is now known, that this difference was between ſome ſecular and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick perſons, and the ſole Levites; ſo that this cannot help the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Preachers except they will ſhew that they alone are the true Levites, and that all other ſecular men are of other tribes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, its known that all this difference was ceremoniall in the buſineſſe of the Prieſthood, which God by an expreſſe law had tied to the temple, and ſo likewiſe all the Levites; but now it is certain that all this was ceremoniall, and tyed to the temple, as we may fee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> which conſiſted in entring into the Holy of holies, lawfull only for the High-Prieſt, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ark and other things, in ſacrificing within the temple on the altar, and other things which God preſcribed, how they were to be performed by the Levites alone. But now we ſee that the Temple is overthrown and all theſe ſacred things aboliſhed, and all ſacrifices ceaſed with Chriſts paſſion; who then ſees not that this ſpeciall Leviticall priviledge is alſo ceaſed and abrogated? ſo that if the true Levites ſhould ariſe again, they would confeſſe that the Temple and ſacred Ceremonies being aboliſhed, their ſpeciall
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114151:119"/>is alſo ceaſed, becauſe it ſhould be now of no uſe. Out of this we may ſee what a ſtiffe Levite the <hi>Walachrian</hi> is, who elſewhere ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to dig up again Judaiſme, that he could not endure the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Organs in churches; here he is more light then the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Levites, and will reſerve the Levitical ſanctity of ſpeciall right, though the temple with all its ſacrifices and ceremonies be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>But let us yield that there remains at this day among Chriſtians a Leviticall ſeparation, muſt he therefore do what he pleaſeth in appointing the ſacred rites of Divine worſhip? this was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the old and true Levites. If the High-Prieſt had ſaid to the other Prieſts, it is lawfull only for me to enter into the Holy of holies, therefore you muſt not enter into the holy place; they had denied this, becauſe God had otherwiſe appointed. If the Prieſts had ſaid to the people and Magiſtrates, it's lawfull only for us to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, therefore it is not lawfull for you to come hither, to ſee theſe ſacred things, to pray, to teach in the temple, to celebrate the paſſeover and circumciſion, and to perform other parts of divine worſhip; they had been laughed at by the Magiſtrates, becauſe God had not allotted all thoſe things by ſpeciall right to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, nor had he prohibited them to the people and Magiſtrates. Here I hope the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Levite will ſee his own unſavoury li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, which he learned with other things from his maſters the Papiſts, who that they might adorn the dreſſing of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice with the greater pomp, to catch ſimple ſoules, they have borrowed moſt of them from the Levitical Prieſthood, ſuch as they pleaſed, but ſo that they fitly adorned their Comedy. The Levites of old were conſecrated and ſet apart for holy duties, ſo are the Clergie there; they had their holy veſtments, ſo theſe; they had their ſacrifices, ſo theſe their unbloody ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which no Lay-man muſt touch; they had their High-Prieſt, ſo theſe their Pope; the High-Prieſt were a crown, the Pope wears 3 crowns; the High-Prieſt had a breaſt-plate, the Pope hath <hi>Peters</hi> cloak; the Levites had their <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> the Popes conclave is his <hi>ſanctorum ſanctorum;</hi> in the Leviticall holy of holies was the Ark and Propitiatory; in the Popes conclave is Peters chair. There be many other ſacred things, which I confeſſe I am ignorant of; there was one chiefly among the Levites, which was the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in the Holy of holies, whence God gave his infallible oracles by the High-Prieſt: ſo when the Pope fits in his conclave,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114151:119"/>and in <hi>Peters</hi> chair, he ſaith, that God by him gives infallible ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; not in all things, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, (for that were too palpable a lie) but in matters of faith and generall manners; ſo that if the Pope ſhould deliver every day an hundred oracles out of his conclave, which were plainly falſe, yet he ſhould be alwayes free from falſhood, either becauſe he failed only in the determination of a particular fact, or by what meanes ſoever he were convinced of lies, yet he ſhall never erre from that infinite ſcope of veritie, which is the generall preſcription of faith and manners; ſo that if in the conclave the Pope ſhould play the wanton with his whore (as it fell out in the Delphick temple) and not his Oracles, but his Miſtreſſes ſhould thence be delivered to the Church, we muſt not doubt but that it is of moſt high holineſſe, whatſoever iſſues out of that moſt holy place. So then every one may ſee, that the acts and ſcenes of old Popery are moſt finely fitted according to Judaiſme. <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſeeks the like among the Proteſtants, but hitherto (for ought I know) he hath not found them.</p>
               <p>We ſhould wiſh ſurely,
<note place="margin">Par. 1 p. 391</note> that according to the liberty of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian</hi> heaven, under which he is born and educated, and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to all kinds of boldneſſe, he had called <hi>a boat a boat,</hi> and <hi>an egge an egge;</hi> for it is not ſafe for us to be always in ſuch danger. Who will not pity <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi> who was ſtruck dead by touching the Ark only, which was not to be touched. Was not <hi>Sauls</hi> fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, in daring to ſacrifice partly out of feare, and partly out of impatience for <hi>Samuels</hi> long ſtaying? whereby he fell not only into the diſpleaſure of <hi>Samuel,</hi> but alſo of God himſelf. What Prince will not tremble to ſee <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> ſtruck with leproſie, for touching that which he ſhould not have touched;
<note place="margin">Quid apud reformates ſanctum ſanctorum.</note> whereby whilſt he lived he was deprived of his kingdome, and when he died, of the Kings ſepulcher? So then the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will do a moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, if he will hereafter unfold what things in his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government are not to be touched.</p>
               <p>I could never yet find the place of <hi>holy of holies</hi> among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, except it be among the <hi>Walachrians, Apollonius</hi> his ſtudy, where with his <hi>Tertullus</hi> and other conſpirators he is ſecretly plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to overthrow the Magiſtracie of <hi>Middleburg,</hi> and to erect a new Papal hierarchy. Though the Conſiſtory be a conventicle of ſuperlative Spirituality there, yet it doth not ſeem to me to deſerve the name of the Holy of Holies, becauſe the Keeper, with Women, &amp; dogs, do familiarly go in thither; and then there muſt be alſo ſo
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114151:120"/>many Holy of Holies as there be Churches: therefore in this point the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Judaiſme is fallen into a ſwound.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Levites</hi> have no externall ſacrifices peculiar, except they will have the Maſſe with Papiſts: Spirituall ſacrifices are Almes, Prayers, Pſalms, which are called the calves of the lips, and the whole reaſonable ſervice of God, which is commanded as common to all Chriſtians. So that we are ſure Magiſtracie cannot be removed from all theſe, by reaſon of any ſpecial ſanctity. For who will ſay that it is unlawfull for Magiſtrates to pray in the Church? He may (ſaith the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi>) but not publikely: Then ſanctity here conſiſteth in a circumſtance, to wit, the ſame prayers uttered in private are holy in a common manner, but in a ſpeciall manner holy if they be ſaid by the Miniſter in publike. This ſubtile difference is no where mentioned in Scripture: but the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Levite differs much from old Judaiſme; their ſacrificing was a ſpeciall priviledge not only in publike, but in private alſo: for if they had granted to them that were not Levites to ſacrifice privately in the temple, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the right of ſacrificing publikely to themſelves, the Levites had polluted their ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſo ſacrilegious a thing for the Magiſtrate to pray publikely in the Church, and like women to be ſilent; why not only is leave given to Magiſtrates, but alſo to women to ſing open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with a loud voice in the church? for this alſo is a ſpirituall ſacrifice of praiſe. In this ſurely he ſeems to proſtitute his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, unleſſe he will ſay that this liberty is alſo taken away from Chriſtians, becauſe it is the Precentor, whoſe ſinging hath the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priviledge of ſanctity, whoſe tune the whole Congregation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; but ſo the Precentor alſo ſhould be received among thoſe that have the ſpeciall right of ſanctity: but I think this Mechanical ſmell will be too Goatiſh for <hi>Apollonius</hi> to make him partaker of the authoritative and ſpeciall right of preaching <hi>ſtacte.</hi> I confeſſe there is ſmall difference; becauſe this man only in of the book ſings the Pſalms and ſacred hymns, but the other not willing to be a clerk in the book, prayeth there without book, yea I believe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without the Bible, whatſoever the Apollonian ſpirit is able in his heat to ſome out. There are indeed very godly prayers ſet out by <hi>Calvin</hi> and other Divines in their Catechiſme, for this purpoſe, that all the people may be acquainted with them, and ſo may be uttered by one ſpirit, the Paſtor going before, which uſe many times the Church in Synods hath eſtabliſhed: but theſe things
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114151:120"/>are vulgar, and come too neer that ſtrait and bookiſh ſpirituality of the Precentors, to ſatisfie the ſpirit of the <hi>Stilt-walker,</hi> that moſt ſervent Zelot.</p>
               <p>This, laſtly, is a wonder, That he placeth ſpeciall ſanctity in publike prayer; when under the ancient Levites, <hi>Anna</hi> Samuels mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Solomon</hi> at the dedication of the temple, K. <hi>Ezek.</hi> &amp; in Chriſts time the Phariſee and Publican, did pray publikely in the temple. I confeſſe that the buſines of prayer hath bin ſometimes upon ſpecial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted extraordinarily to ſome, as to <hi>Iſaac, Moſes; Noe, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job;</hi> but this was no Levitical or ordinary priviledge, but proceeded from the perſon, whether eccleſiaſtical or civil, as he was moſt in Gods favour. It were to be wiſhed that all they to whom the Magiſtrate hath out of his bounty given charge to pray publikely, may not be only fit to do that modeſtly, but alſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God for their piety; for in many there is ſuch a confuſed babling, and ſuch an impuritie in their hands, that we may feare leſt by ſuch meſſengers the Church-prayers prove deteſtable to God, I conclude that there was no ſpeciall ſanctitie in prayers under the Levites; why then ſhould it be under theſe new Levites?</p>
               <p>He ſeeks for prerogative in <hi>Preaching;</hi> and ſaith,
<note place="margin">Praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in private for all men to preach, but in publike only for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; for this is authoritative and poteſtative, and by right of the <hi>Legat,</hi> that is only edifying. Much more ſuch ſtuffe he hath deviſed upon this matter, but without Scripture: ſo that here again ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie conſiſts in the circumſtance, much different from that of the ancient Levites for if the High-Prieſt had placed his ſpecial ſanctity in this, that he entred publikely and by day-time into the Holy of Holies, but he granted to the reſt of the people that privately and in the night-time like rats they ſhould creep into the holy of holies; he had certainly polluted his ſacred myſteries. This new Levite is no leſſe ridiculous, who gives leave to Magiſtrates, Lay-men and women, to preach privately the ſame Word, but reſerves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the circumſtance of preaching publikely in the Pulpit. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance was not of ſuch ſanctitie among the Levites, much leſſe among the Apoſtles; for they would not have been ſo bountifull as to grant to every one who was fit, leave to preach publikely, ſo that they did not forbid women to propheſie with their heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, if occaſion ſerved; otherwiſe let <hi>Apollonius</hi> reſolve me how <hi>Paul,</hi> who elſwhere bids women be ſilent, ſaith expreſly, <hi>A woman praying or propheſying with her head uncovered, diſhonoureth her head.</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:114151:121"/>For <hi>Paul</hi> doth not give charge of that which was never to be, if it was abſolutely unlawfull for women to propheſie; neither doth he ſpeak of any private ſpeaking at home, for it was not required there that ſhe ſhould in that caſe be alwaies covered. Then it is certain that this ſubtle difference of preaching ſanctitie was not known to the Apoſtles, that the Paſtor alone ſhould preach in publike by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſanctity; and authoritatively, but not others who did this in private.</p>
               <p>He placeth wonderfull ſanctitie in the right of <hi>Calling;</hi> but in this alſo he deviates from the old Levites: they were born Levites; and if particularly they were ſelected to the prieſthood, or to any office of ſpeciall priviledge, this was done commonly by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, not by the Levites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> a Magiſtrate,
<note place="margin">Num. 20.28.</note> made <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-prieſt; he put on his robes, and took them off, and ſet up <hi>Eleazar</hi> after him. There were many famous Prieſts, but God preferred the Magiſtrate. They ſay that he did this exrraordinarily as a Prophet, but this the Scripture doth not affirm, but by not ſhewing the cauſe of a matter of ſuch importance, intimates that this difference is nothing. So <hi>David</hi> did order the Leviticall miniſtery;
<note place="margin">1 King. 22.26.35.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> thruſt <hi>Abiathar</hi> from his prieſthood, and ſet up <hi>Sadoc</hi> in his ſtead: neither was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion decayed, nor is he ſaid to have taken adviſe of the Levites, but this he did of his own authority, neither had he done this if he had ſuppoſed that in it there was ſo great danger of ſacriledge. If then the Levites had no peculiar priviledge of calling, the new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt did ill to borrow this from them.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame nature is their priviledge of <hi>[Judicature and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring]</hi> which he calls the Legiſlative power, and of the Keyes. This alſo was not peculiar to the Levites, but had under God its generall originall from the Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.9.12.</note> Joſhuah, David, Solomon, Jehoſophat, Joſias,</hi> all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, not eccleſiaſtick Levites, ordained eccleſiaſtick lawes. God gave indeed to the Levites and to the High-Prieſt, power to judge by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet not apart from the Magiſtrates, but jointly with them: yea becauſe twice he puts the ſecular Judge in the laſt place, it is not unlikely that he place the principal right of Judicature in the Magiſtrate, from whom the power of puniſhing depended. So that this new Levite is a plain perverter of Levitical priviledge, who under pretence of a Levitical cuſtome goeth about to thruſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates from the legiſlative &amp; judicatory power in Church-matters;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114151:121"/>when on the contrary we ſee, that God by an expreſſe command hath, in point of Judicature, joyned the Magiſtrate with the Levites.</p>
               <p>Nor were the Apoſtles of any other mind, who admitted the whole Church, which conſiſted of Lay-men, in all weighty matters of the Church, both of Calling, Making of Lawes, and Cenſuring;
<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> ſo that they gave them power alſo of Deciſion, which they had not done, had they conceived that it was altogether unlawfull for the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Now reſts the right of <hi>[Administring the Sacraments]</hi> which with <hi>Apollonius</hi> is of ſuch preciſe ſanctity, that it is to him as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> or the Holy of holies, from which not only he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars Elders and Deacons, as well as carnall Magiſtrates, but alſo the Proponents themſelves under pain of ſacriledge: ſo that in this he placeth the heighth of his authoritative and poteſtative preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is with the priviledge of adminiſtring the Sacraments, as he wrote to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this fiction truly he hath plainly forſaken the old Leviticall priviledge; for in this they had no ſpeciall right; ſeeing the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over at firſt was killed by any one in his own family, Circumciſion was adminiſtred at home by the father,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 5. 1 Cor. 10.</note> or <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Magiſtrate did it by publike authority; all did gather and eat <hi>Manna,</hi> they all did drink of the Rock that followed them, they were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the ſea and cloud. Theſe were the ſpirituall Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, which were common to all; nor had the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites alone any ſpeciall right in theſe, but by proceſſe of time it fell out that the adminiſtration of theſe was ſolemnly performed by the Levites. But this was rather brought in by cuſtome, then by Gods law, which ſeems rather to be againſt it.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Walachrian</hi> here forſakes his old Levites, ſo he cannot claim the Apoſtles for him in this preciſeneſſe, in that the power of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing was of leſſe eſteem among them then of Preaching; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath not ſent me to baptize, but to preach;</hi> he alſo thanks God that he did not baptize many. How much is this from the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Divinity? <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> proveth, that preſently after the Apoſtles, Lay-men baptized, which Chriſtians had not done ſo quiekly, had they ſuſpected that the preciſe and ſacred right conſiſted in this.</p>
               <p>The like reaſon is of adminiſtring the <hi>Supper,</hi> the preciſe right of which (ſo far as I can perceive) came from Popery, where the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114151:122"/>Supper was turned into an Idol. If in the right of adminiſtring this Sacrament, there did conſiſt ſo much ſanctity and preciſeneſſe as the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> feigns, the Holy Ghoſt had done imprudently in ſaying nothing of a matter of ſuch importance in Scripture, but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>It's commonly alleadged, that Chriſt inſtituted the firſt Supper, took bread, brake and diſtributed it; likewiſe the wine. Becauſe Chriſt was Paſtor and Doctor of his Church; hence they take it for a ſure law, that none but the Paſtor, not a Doctor, muſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Supper. I have ſhewed already that this ground of the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> is imperfect, and now again I ſhew it. Chriſt waſhed the Apoſtles feet, refelled the Scribes and Phariſees objections, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the parables and obſcure paſſages of Religion; he prayed for all the elect: Muſt therefore no man but the Paſtor waſh the Apoſtles feet, refell objections, explain the doubts of Religion, pray? &amp;c. Chriſt uſed to pray at feaſts, muſt therefore hence a law be made that in weddings and feaſts none muſt pray but the paſtor? If the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> too curiouſly affect this example, he will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that he deſires to borrow alſo from Papiſts this gluttonous Spiritualty, among whom it is an old cuſtom, that the Paſtor ſhould ſit down firſt at the feaſt, and by right of Spirituality ſit next to the bride. Chriſt did many things upon occaſion, which are not lawes for us to imitate, except it be expreſſed that this example is ſo, and no otherwiſe to be followed, which the Scripture in this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance never doth, no more then that the Supper muſt be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred at night,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> or in unleavened bread, becauſe Chriſt did both. Beſides, in that place of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the inſtitution of the Supper, there is no ſuch thing found, but rather the contrary; For <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not this properly to the Biſhops only, but to the whole body of the Church; for he ſaith, that he delivers to them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of celebrating the Supper, which he received from Chriſt. What was that? Not only to receive the bread broken, and eat; but to take, break, eat, drink, diſtribute among themſelves with reverence; For he ſaith, that all this rite which he received from Chriſt, he delivers to them. I wonder whence this ſuperſtitious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſhould ariſe, that the Paſtors alone, under pain of ſacrilege, muſt have right to [receive, break and diſtribute] the Bread with the Wine, and that other Chriſtians muſt only receive, eat &amp; drink, and examine themſelves well before, as a certain Divine ſpeaks; for although he enjoyns the whole Church with the Biſhops, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114151:122"/>they ſhould each one prove themſelves: yet the moderne Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie aſſume alſo this priviledge to themſelves, of preſcribing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power to trie themſelves, whereof they are to be Judges; but to trie themſelves, they think they are not liable to, but that they may without any proofe at all thruſt in upon the Sacrament: For, by vertue of their ſpeciall ſpirituality, they may diſpenſe with trying themſelves, and with all their vices. He that doth not ſmell this Popiſh Garlick, he is certainly a dull-noſed Divine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gather out of this place, that Paſters alone have not right to take bread in the Supper, to breake and diſtribute it; and that it is no ſacriledge, if a Deacon, Elder or faithfull Magiſtrate, or any other member of the Church that is a godly man, do the ſame.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that for orders ſake, and decency, in proceſſe of time, theſe ſolemne actions were appropriated to preaching Miniſters; but this did not proceed from any divine precept; and therfore if any be ſo ſuperſtitious, as to believe, in caſe the Paſtor be dead, abſent, or ſicke, that a Deacon, Elder, or any famous member of the Church had miniſter the Sacrament, he ſeems to me to have licked, not onely the outward, but the inward rine alſo of the Maſſe. Briefly I will ſay this: <hi>Apollonius</hi> can finde nothing in the ancient Leviticall worſhip, which by ſpeciall right he can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre as ſacred into the moderne Church-diſcipline: For, all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of this moderne government, which he counts ſo ſpecially holy, were under the Levites, not of any ſpeciall right, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Magiſtrates. He took theſe rather from the Papiſts, but ſo unfitly, that both Prieſts and Levites may laugh at him.</p>
               <p>His laſt dart againſt Magiſtrates is cleft into divers parts, filled with poyſon of malice and contempt.</p>
               <p>Magiſtracie is <hi>onely a ſeparable accident of the Church;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of the baſeſt Members of the Church: whence hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that it is a moſt unworthy thing, that the Magiſtrate ſhould guide the Church and perform Church-buſineſſes. I anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> did againe pre-ſuppoſe a falſhood, that in the Apoſtles time, and at other times, the Church wanted a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, of whom againe I will diſcourſe. Now I will explode this Philoſophers conſequence; he thinks that to be a ſeparable accident, which can be a way without the deſtruction of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114151:123"/>whether it be a ſubſtance or an accident, by which ſhiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie he can make at his pleaſure an accident of a ſubſtance, to wit, if a thiefe take away <hi>Apollonius</hi> his cloak from him, then it will be an accident, if in his purſe hee hath ten Crownes, and his purſe-bearer ſteale one, becauſe <hi>Apollonius</hi> his purſe remaines with the reſt of his money, that crowne will bee then not a ſubſtance, but an accident; ſo that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> muſt not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if he ſomtimes have ſuch a loſſe, ſeeing it is but the loſſe of an accident; nor will the thiefe deſerve any great puniſhment, who did not ſteale a ſubſtance but an accident. If we may prate ſo in Divinity, then the written Word of God will prove an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſeparable from the Church, becauſe without it the Church hath been ſometime: the Apoſtolick office will be an accident of the Church, becauſe the Church was ſometime without it, and is now againe; and let me ſpeak without blaſphemy, Chriſts actuall paſſion and incarnation will be a ſeparable accident of the Church, becauſe it was onely in the fulneſſe of time, and now long ſince hath ceaſed: So abſurd then is this Philoſophie. What if Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be accidentall to the Church? Will it therefore follow that the Magiſtrate can do nothing in the Church? Are not accidents the originall of all operations, without which ſubſtances can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? For though a coal burneth, yet it burneth not without a fiery quality and heat. I will not urge further this abſurdity of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> becauſe I know that he is more affraid of this ſecular accident then he hath hope in an Eccleſiaſtick ſubſtance, ſo that accidentally he vexeth himſelfe and in vaine, in thruſting this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident out of the Church: which if it were abſent, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Eccleſiaſtick ſubſtances, on a ſudden, heat and cold bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, moiſt and dry would bring in again the old <hi>chaos;</hi> ſo that I may truly ſay againſt <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Tenent, the ſecular accident ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains the Eccleſiaſtick ſubſtance, or els it would fall to the ground. But now I will paſſe from the accident to the ſubſtance: For, the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is ſuch a wonderfull Philoſopher that of Magiſtrates he can on a ſudden make an accident, and againe a ſubſtance; for he makes them members of the Church, but of the meaneſt or vileſt ſort, the reaſon is becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſet them to judge who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.4.</note> whence by a <hi>Walachrian</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, he concludes, that at all times the meaneſt members of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114151:123"/>Church are to be Judges;
<note place="margin">part. 1. p. 14, 15.</note> wherefore by inverting the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he collects, that whoſoever are Judges are to be accounted for the meaneſt members of the Church, though they had been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the moſt learned of the Church. Thus doth hee uſe the Scripture like a noſe of wax, that he may perſwade us, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giftrates are to be eſteemed no better then Aſſes, as the Papiſts compare Magiſtrates and Kings to the Aſſe on which Chriſt ſate. I do not think the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> wrote this in earneſt, for they ſay, that he earneſtly endeavours to place his Legate <hi>a latere</hi> on the bench directly, that ſo he may ſit in it alſo indirectly: But now I will ſhew how he handleth the Scripture irreverently, and abuſeth this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he may make it ſerve his phancie. This I will cleare by a plaine explication of the words, there was an ill cuſtome among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that Chriſtians went to law one with another about worldly buſineſſes, which controverſies they did not take up among themſelves, but had them decided by Magiſtrates that were Infidels and Enemies of Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> (as hee ought to have done) reproves this cuſtome, and like a good Phyſitian preſcribes remedies to mend it, one whereof was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt, that they ſhould lay aſide their quarrels, and rather <hi>ſuffer loſſe,</hi> for if all Chriſtians were of this moderation, rather to ſuffer loſſe then to go to Law, all occaſions of quarrell would be cut off: But the <hi>Corinthians</hi> wanted this moderation; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, you yourſelves <hi>do wrong and defraud your Brethren,</hi> therefore hee farther perſwades them, that if they would goe to Law, they ſhould remaine within the Church which was then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the unfaithfull Magiſtrates, and that they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves take up their quarrels. He uſeth many reaſons for this purpoſe, eſpecially this, that no faithfull man ſhould be ſo unfit to judge, but that hee may eaſily be able to judge an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell or wicked man; for, he ſaith, that faithfull Chriſtians ſhall judge the world: whence he concludes, if the godly are reſerved for judging of ſuch great matters, it were abſurd, if they were not able to judge of triviall and worldly matters. Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared their abſurditie in chooſing wicked and unfaithfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates for their Judges; for they were inferiour to Chriſtians, they did all one, as if they had made the baſeſt amongſt them their Judges, paſſing by thoſe that were worthieſt; to this <hi>Pauls</hi> words
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114151:124"/>tend, <hi>they that are of leaſt eſteem among you make them Judges,</hi> which ironically he ſpeakes, not that hee approved that Judges ſhould be choſen of the meaneſt perſons, but contrarily he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes that evill cuſtome, for hee ſaith preſently, <hi>I ſpeake this to your ſhame; is there never a wiſe-man among you, who may judge between brother and brother?</hi> By which words he doth plainly ſhew, that he doth not like their cuſtome in going to law before Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, becauſe in doing ſo, they made the meaneſt men their Judges; but this (he ſaith) is prepoſterous, becauſe this belongs rather to the wiſer ſort, ſo that he upbraids them for want of wiſe men, and in that they paſſed by their brethren, and made Infidell Magiſtrates Judges of their differences, whom they exceeded, or ſhould have exceeded in wiſdome. This is the plaine meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, which overthroweth the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> fooleries: He thinks that <hi>Paul</hi> here made a perpetuall and abſolute Law, as if they that ſate on the Benches, and were Judges of ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, that is, Magiſtrates, were, in reſpect of their Magiſtracy, the meaneſt perſons alwayes; whereas on the contrary, <hi>Paul</hi> conſiders this meaneſſe in reſpect of infidelity, becauſe they were then Infidelis that bare the office of Magiſtracie: Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon ceaſeth in Magiſtrates, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come faithfull. And whereas they are ſuch, under whom now the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> lives, hee is injurious to ubpraid them with this meanneſſe, which <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſely impoſeth onely on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> his other perverſneſſe is, in calling Magiſtracie baſe, and the Magiſtrates baſe, in reſpect of their office; when as <hi>Paul</hi> aſſevereth, that the office of a Judge is ſo excellent, that it ſhould not be committed to the baſeſt, but to the wiſeſt: So that he reproves them for want of wiſe men among them, that they were forced to appeale to Infidells, who were not wiſer, or worthier then Chriſtians, but rather, becauſe of their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, baſer: And therefore they did ill when they made them their Judges, by which meanes they accuſed themſelves of unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unskilfulneſſe, and prepoſterouſly conferred the office of judicature upon baſe and unworthy perſons. So then, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes the office of judicature and Magiſtracie to be moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and therefore to belong onely to wiſe men, ſo it be not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114151:124"/>transferred upon Infidells, for then it is accidentally conferred on the meaneſt. Is not then the <hi>Walachrian</hi> injurious, to account faithfull Magiſtrates baſe, whom <hi>Paul</hi> thinks worthy of honour, and the prerogative of wiſdome.</p>
               <p>I have now examined the arguments, or rather ſcoffs and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies with which the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> would perſwade us that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are ſo carnall and vile, that they neither can nor ſhould meddle with the holy and ſpirituall affaires of the Church, ſuch as they are at this day. And ſo unbridled he is in his language, that he could not raile with greater audacity, if he had the ſole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatorſhip in the State of the united Provinces.</p>
               <p>For, what <hi>Nathan, Eliah,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> who were divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, durſt thus raile againſt impious Magiſtrates, as he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt godly ones? You (ſaith he) are onely <hi>a ſeparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Church,</hi> your power is not in, but about the Church, you are the <hi>baſeſt members</hi> in reſpect of your Magiſtracie: you are onely <hi>carnall and worldly,</hi> who are not to meddle with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of heaven, but of earth; and if you would aſcend higher, to handle the holy affaires of our Church-government; <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for you to handle or touch them,</hi> ſo that you cannot meddle with ſpirituall things, and belonging to the ſalvation of ſoules, <hi>by your ſelves, but by us:</hi> you are not <hi>to preſcribe lawes to us in Church-matters,</hi> or abrogate <hi>without the conſent of Church-men the lawes preſcribed by Church-men,:</hi> controverſies and Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <hi>are not to be judged by you,</hi> nor can there be from hence <hi>appeales to you;</hi> yea whatſoever Church-men ſhall in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ordaine or judge, that you are by your <hi>cumulative power to approv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I onely proferre the gleanings: he that will have the whole crop, let him repaire to his patched peeces, and they will ſee that he is no leſſe mad, then if he had been hired by the Pope or Spaniard to ſtirre up the people againſt the Magiſtrates and united States. For, no man is ſo ignorant, that ſeeth not the lawes which he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114151:125"/>poſitively ſets downe, to be broken by the Magiſtrates in their Synods and other Church-buſineſſes; and that therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as being wicked and ſacrilegious, to be deſtroyed by the people, and thruſt out of their Magiſtracie: that theſe things are indirectly intended by thoſe <hi>Walachrian</hi> Sticklers, every one may ſee who is not blinde. I recommend the care of this buſineſſe to the Magiſtrates, as Fathers of the Countrey; and I will further ſhew, with what priviledges God doth honour them in Scripture, what power they had in Church-affaires in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently, what their office is at this day.</p>
               <p>That is a famous elogie above the reſt,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.23 &amp; 60.16.</note> which God gives to Kings and Magiſtrates, in that they were to be the <hi>nurſing Fathers of the Church,</hi> which Propheſie is twice repeated in <hi>Eſay;</hi> by which metaphor is ſhewed, that Magiſtrates ſhould be as it were keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and nurſes, to nouriſh and feed the Church. Which if it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Magiſtrate in reſpect of his office, how ſhould he be without the Church? For, who will not ſay, it is an abſurdity, that the nurſe, who ſhould feed the infants of the family, muſt be placed without the houſe? no other wayes, then if a Ship-maſter or Pilot be placed without the ſhip.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſtormes againſt this title, and ſaith, That it muſt be underſtood warily;
<note place="margin">part. 1. p. 29, 30.</note> at laſt he concludes, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Magiſtrate to nouriſh Chriſtians with the dug, which is not much leſſe, then to upbraid the Prophet with falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who plainly ſaith, it ſhall be, which this man boldly ſaith, ſhall not be, by Kings properly, but by Churchmen: ſo that the Prophet ſhould rather have fore-told, Church-men ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, not Kings.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe this title is figurative, and not to be drawne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Prophets intention: This is alſo true; that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates cannot properly nouriſh the Church, as nurſes doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; but ſo neither can any Eccleſiaſticks doe at this day: For, as I ſaid before, no man is properly a father, but he that hath ſeed within him, and generates: not he who caſts anothers ſeed; ſo none is a nurſe preciſely, but ſhe that hath milk in her breſts, and with this nurſeth the infant; which honour belongs to none, but to God onely.</p>
               <p>Gods grace alone is the nurſe properly, whoſe two breſts are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114151:125"/>the old and new Teſtament, in which all ſaring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>I think the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will ſay, that there is no abſurdity, if he transferre the milk drawne out of the breſts of Stripture into his braine, as into a dug, and from thence imparting it to the Church, he performe the nurſes part. But I ſay, this is an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way of nouriſhing: for, as often as his ſtudy transferrs the milk which he ſucks and drawes out of Scripture, into his braine, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a milk-paile, which is rank with malice, and the filth of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: the milk which he diſtributes to Chriſtians is vitiated by the veſſell of his corrupted braine, which is improperly to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. So that now properly the queſtion is concerning the right of diſtributing the milk which is contained in the breſts of holy Scripture. The old and new Papiſts excluding the Magiſtrate, ſay that this right belongs onely to them.

               <p>The new Papiſts are more warie, but withall more baſec they commannd all Chriſtians to ſuck out of the breaſts of Scripture, and to abound in it; this alſo they command the Magiſtrates, that they would flow with it, and beſtow it upon others; or cauſe it to be beſtowed: yet they cry out that it is unlawfull for any or impoſſible; except hee be a Church-man, to diſtribute any drop of this nutritive milke; becauſe they alone have a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114151:126"/>power to conferre it by reaſon of their Vocation: they confeſſe indeed, that it is lawfull for Magiſtrates, and all private men to beſtow this milke privately; but they will have us believe, that whatſoever they doe there is not one drop of true nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive milke beſtowed by them: for this is <hi>Stapletons</hi> perpetuall fraud, that Gods Word is not truly milke, but as it is preached by the Church, which is as much as if you would ſay, milke is not properly nutritive as it is milke, but as it is publikely diſtributed; ſo that in this they are like baſe Monopoliſts, who confeſſe the milke to be nutritive in it ſelf, however it be drawn in or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of the breaſt privately: But they will not have it to bee accounted ſo, except it be brought from them only.</p>
               <p>I know, it is an old ſong, that this right is conferred onely up on Church-men by their vocation: but I have ſhewed before ſometimes, that now there is no Vocation which is divine, or which ſhewes any divine effects, or confers any divine right, but that it is meerly humane both in the manner and right thereof, which though it was divine of old, yet now it depends onely from the gifts requiſite for that function, which if they be found in any, his Vocation tieth him as a hireling of neceſſity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this office, but hindereth not others (who are alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with theſe gifts) from the free exerciſe thereof: whence appeares the fraud and violence of Papiſts, chiefly of the new ones, who confeſſe that the quickning ſaving milk is contained in the breaſts of the Scripture, out of which, all may ſuck and draw, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Lay-men, and may diſtribute it privately, but publikely they muſt not, or if they doe, it is not nutritive, which are meer moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries. However I have been large in diſcourſing of this nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet this I affirme, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> by this doubled and rare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy did fore-tell ſome extraordinary matter of Magiſtrates, when hee ſaith, that they ſhall be nurſing Fathers of the Church. <hi>Apollonius</hi> thinks that nothing elſe is fore-told but onely that they ſhall procure bountifull ſtipends for Church-men, to fatten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well, and ſo may nouriſh the Church the better: But this was no new or extraordinary matter, God himſelfe provided meat for the <hi>Levites,</hi> and godly Kings had now a long time done that plentifully; and it ſeems abſurd to adſcribe ſuch a worke to Kings, the chiefe perfection whereof could never bee reached by them, but by Church-men onely.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:114151:126"/>
               <p>Wherefore this ſeemes to agree with the ſaid Prophet, that Kings and Magiſtrates in the New Teſtament, the Leviticall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration being taken away, ſhould handle all eccleſiaſtick buſineſſe by themſelves, or elſe that they ſhould bee ſo diligent in them, that if they did not perform all things by themſelves, yet at leaſt, they ſhould bee ſo diligent in procuring of them, that they ſhould goe before church-men, take the charge of them, and preſcribe to them no other wayes than if a Mother Queen who had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her infant to bee nurſed and bred by nurſes, and her hand-maids, afterward out of her motherly care ſhould ſit down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong her nurſes and maids, and give her own breſts to bee ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, performing her ſelfe all the parts of a nurſe, which we ſee many famous Princes have done in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Above other titles, that of God is moſt illuſtrious, with which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> honoureth Princes, which title we never finde in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture given to church-men. <hi>Aaron</hi> was an eminent man, and was to bee the moſt worthy High-Prieſt; yet God ſaid not, I will make thee <hi>a God to Moſes,</hi> but contrarily, I will <hi>make Moſes a God to thee;</hi> whence wee ſee that God from the beginning did not purpoſe to commit the ſupream care of the world, and of the Church to church-men, but to ſecular Magiſtrates; for hee knew that things would not be well guided by church-men, as appears by <hi>Aaron,</hi> who when <hi>Moſes</hi> was abſent but 40. dayes, was of ſuch a ſoft, and effeminate ſpirit, that preſently upon the prayers and menaces of the people, turned the whole worſhip into Idolatry: this was the cauſe that when Chriſt was asked of the Apoſtles concerning government, hee permitted it to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but denied it preciſely to church-men: ſo that in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous title <hi>of God</hi> all church-men are ſubject to the civill powers; and all civill powers are to rule the church-men: for theſe are called only Angels, but they <hi>gods,</hi> who will not confeſſe men to bee ſubordinate to Gods, and Gods to have ſuperiority over men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt not but <hi>Apollonius</hi> will here murmur with himſelfe, that the Prophet did ſo unwiſely beſtow this title upon Magiſtrates, when out of the principles of <hi>Walachrian</hi> divinity, this title of God belongs rather to church-men, than to Magiſtrates, for theſe as ſheep ſhould be ſubject to their eccleſiaſtick paſtors. Magiſtrates are only <hi>earthly Kings,</hi> but cleargy-men are <hi>beavenly,</hi> Magiſtrates
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114151:127"/>are Legats of <hi>God the Creator;</hi> church-men of Chriſt <hi>the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor exalted:</hi> laſtly Magiſtrates are <hi>carnall and worldly,</hi> but church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are <hi>ſpirituall and holy,</hi> who ſeeth not from hence that church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come neerer to God, than Magiſtrates, and that therefore the name of God belongs more juſtly to them? So that wee need not doubt but in time the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will mend this magnificat; as his predeceſſor the Pope did, who not being content with the titles of Biſhop paſtor, and preſident, in which the <hi>Walachrian</hi> for the time rejoyceth, hath aſſumed to himſelfe alſo the title of God; ſo that now hee is ſtiled <hi>our lord god the Pope;</hi> but that our proud Miniſters may not riſe to this height among proteſtants, I hope the Magiſtrate will take care, whilſt hee ſhall conſider, that hee alone by divine gift and right doth poſſeſſe this title <hi>of God,</hi> which bee cannot without ſacriledge impart to Miniſters, by which alſo is admoniſhed, that hee is ſubject to none, but to God only, and that there is nothing ſo ſpirituall, ſo holy and ſo heavenly under his juriſdiction, if it be humane, but that it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his power; which will more appear by that famous place of <hi>Paul,</hi> where not only hee is honoured with the name of God, but alſo is endowed with the priviledge of Divine prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
               <p>Among other elogies,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.13. Rom. 13 1</note> that is notable one which is given to the Magiſtrate by <hi>Peter,</hi> and chiefly by <hi>Paul,</hi> where the great dignity of the civill power upon earth is deſcribed, which hee placeth in three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no ſupereminent power armed with the ſword, which is not ſubordinate to God, and by him ordained; for he ſaith that all powers which bear the ſword are ordained by God, and hee that reſiſteth them, <hi>reſiſteth the Ordinance of God:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every ſuch, by what name ſoever it is called, bearing the ſword, hath God for its author: ſo that the Apoſtle doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any man to enquire who or what hee is that uſeth this power, nor how hee hath attained to it, nor indeed how hee uſeth it; but abſolutely commands to give obedience civill, whether to the King as chiefe, or to governours: it was then known to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the Emperors by fraud and violence invaded the Empire, and that they uſed their power tyrannically againſt Chriſtians; ſo that if this generall rule had ſuffered any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114151:127"/>he would have mentioned it: but both the Apoſtles do abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely make this law, That whoſoever poſſeſſeth the ſword, he is ordained by God; nor muſt any doubt of his power. This did <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> well underſtand, when they came within the juriſdiction of <hi>Abimelech; [Perhaps the fear of God is not in this place]</hi> They doubted of the Kings piety and juſtice, but yet they prepared themſelves to obey, even till death. <hi>They will kill me for thy ſake,</hi> ſay they; <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

So that whoſoever out of his own private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſiſteth this he reſiſteth God himſelf, and haſteneth vengeance upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The other is, <hi>That he ſubjects every ſoul to the higher Powers. Origen</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> then every body, becauſe men in reſpect of their bodies differ much, but in reſpect of their ſouls they are all uniform. Whence <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon this place, <hi>Though he be an Apoſtle, though a Prophet, though an Evangeliſt, this ſubjection doth not overthrow piety.</hi> Whence in appears, that no man upon what pretence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever who is under anothers juriſdiction, can free himſelfe from the government of the Civil Magiſtrate, whether he be Clergy or Lay, rich or poor, learned or unlearned, no condition excuſeth him from obedience. Theſe named famous Patriarks, and as it appeared afterward, more excellent then King <hi>Abimilech</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet confeſſed humbly, that even to death they were ſubject whilſt they were under his juriſdiction. Who more worthy then Chriſt? yet he ſubjected himſelf to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> impious Magiſtrates. It is then an unworthy thing for any man to exempt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114151:128"/>himſelf from the Civil power, under pretence of ſanctity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or any prerogative; for this is flat repugnant to <hi>Pauls</hi> generall maxime, That <hi>every ſoule</hi> ſhould be ſubject, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>The third thing is, That he commands <hi>ſubiection</hi> in all, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Magiſtrates; ſo that he will not have them reſiſted, not only <hi>for puniſhment,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſor conſoience,</hi> becauſe he that reſiſteth the Magiſtrate, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and haſteneth judgement againſt himſelf, which to do is againſt a good conſcience. All theſe are emphaticall, and ſhew how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Civil power is over all, and in all things; becauſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely it commands all without exception to be ſubject, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely commands ſubjection without any reſtriction. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there had been ſo many caſes in which ſubjection was not to be given to Magiſtrates, ſuppoſe in ſpirituall and eccleſiaſtick matters, (as the Papiſts at this day prate) the Apoſtles had done unwiſely in commanding Chriſtians ſo abſolutely to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; for they might have known (had they known this new divinity) that Church-men as Chriſts Legats, eſpecially in formall Church-matters, are not any wayes ſubject to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but to Chriſt immediately. <hi>Paul</hi> hath no ſuch cautions and exceptions; whence I collect that he knew them not, but that they are deviſed.</p>
               <p>Muſt all then obey the Magiſtrate,
<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> and in all things? What if he command that which is evill, as not to preach Chriſt, or to commit ſinne; muſt we not then ſay with the Apoſtles, <hi>We ought rather obey God then men?</hi> Therefore the Magiſtrate is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be obeyed in every thing. Whence it followeth, that this law of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning obedience to Magiſtrates, is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. To remove this ſcruple, I will obſerve theſe following paſſages.</p>
               <p>There is an obedience which is <hi>moſt abſolute,</hi> admitting of no conditions or exceptions, ſuch as is due to God in all things, whoſe will is alwayes juſt, and therefore the rule of juſtice, becauſe it is impoſſible that that ſhould not be juſt, which God who is juſtice it ſelf commands. Therefore we muſt alwayes yield abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, becauſe he commands it.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:114151:128"/>
               <p>The ſame power alſo was eminently in Chriſt, God and man; therefore it is ſaid that he taught as one who had authority, and not as the Scribes: for though he ſuffered his commands to be examined becauſe of mens ignorance, yet he was to be obeyed abſolutely, as it was ſaid from Heaven, <hi>Hear him;</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he commanded what was juſt and right, but alſo becauſe he commanded abſolutely.</p>
               <p>The like obedience was due to the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were divinely inſpired, but it was miniſteriall; for though they were not God, yet becauſe the infallible Spirit of God kept them from erring, hence abſolute obedience was yielded to them: ſo that if ſuch now were in the world, abſolute obedience muſt be yielded to them by all, and in all things. But there have been none ſuch now a long time, although the Pope brags this of himſelf falſly as Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>As for the Magiſtrate, he muſt alſo be abſolutely obeyed in all things agreeable to Gods word, or not repugnant to it; ſuch are things indifferent. You I ſay perhaps, that in theſe things we muſt obey Preachers, and all who propoſe them; <hi>ergo,</hi> they are of equall authority with the Magiſtrate. I anſwer, there is great odds; becauſe we obey thoſe only for commanding what is right, but we obey the Magiſtrate becauſe he commands, and becauſe it is right which he commands; for God hath given to them a coactive power and the ſword, by which they command with authority, and can by right of their office compell all ſubjects without exception to fulfill his juſt commands; which ſupreme power belongs only to them by divine right, which is here inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>But as for evil and unjuſt commands, which are flatly oppoſite to Gods law, although the ſubject is not bound to obey them, yet he is bound by this law of <hi>Paul</hi> to be ſubject to him, either by counſel and prayer in removing the Prince from his evill purpoſe, or in flying away; or if they cannot do theſe, in ſuffering: ſo did the Apoſtles, and chiefly thoſe famous young men, who ſeeing the Kings wicked edict, endeavoured to perſwade the King with reaſons; when they could not do theſe, nor could they flie, they were caſt into the furnace. Here appears the ſupreme civil p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wer, in commanding not only what is good, but alſo what is evil,
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> with
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114151:129"/>authority. For though in commanding evill, they deviate from the object, for which they ſhall be puniſhed by God, yet they erre not in uſing their abſolute power with which they are inveſted by Divine right.</p>
               <p>Hence then appeares the great difference that is between the Civil and the Eccleſiaſtick power, which the Papiſts ſtrive ſtill to confound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that every Civil power, whether great or ſmall, new or old, of what quality ſoever it be, or by what name ſoever it is called, if ſo be it bear the ſword, it is divine, having God for its author; otherways that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> were not true, <hi>The powers that be are ordained by God.</hi> But among Church-men there be functions which have not God for their author nor the Scripture for their authority; ſuch are Arch-deacons, Arch-biſhops, Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, Abbots, Canons, Cardinals, and ſuch like proud names of offices are not to be acknowledged, but rejected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Civil power it matters not how one hath got the ſword, whether lawfully, fraudulently, or forcibly, as oftentimes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it is more juſt to obtain government by lawfull means, for ſuch can command with a better conſcience: but in reſpect of the power it's no matter, nor is it fit for a Subject to be too carefully inquiſitive in this, but he ought to obey and acknowledge Gods ordinance whereſoever he ſeeth the force of the ſword; For how could <hi>Paul</hi> truly ſay, <hi>The powers that be are ordained of God, and whoſoever reſiſts them reſiſts Gods ordinance?</hi> It is otherwiſe in Eccleſiaſticks: if any enter in at the back-door by ſymony or fraud, Chriſt ſaith he is a thief, and muſt be accounted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded as a robber, but no wayes to be obeyed or acknowledged for a Paſtor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If he too rigidly command good things or indifferent, or if he command unjuſt things, to which the Conſcience is not bound; the Subject muſt not tell him that the things which he commands are not neceſſary, but unjuſt, therefore we will not, or we are not bound to obey: but on the contrary, Subjects muſt obey; or if they obey not, he hath the ſword, he may by divine right force them. But in Eccleſiaſticks, all their power is conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall: If they teach rightly, command juſtly, and according to Chriſts preſcript, then they muſt be obeyed for Chriſts ſake; but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114151:129"/>if they erre, and command that which is evill, we muſt not obey, but reſiſt them, we muſt drive them out and forſake them, as the Scripture ſhews every where.</p>
               <p>In Miniſters it is required that they be found faithfull; <hi>Believe not every ſpirit, but prove the ſpirits if they be of God,</hi> So Chriſt commands to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> whilſt they ſit in the Chair, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn what is good; but withall he bids us <hi>take heed of their leven;</hi> and if they ſhould go quite out of the way, he will have us leave thoſe blind leaders of the blinde, leſt we fall into the ditch. All which do ſhew that there is no neceſſity of obeying Church-men, but only conditionall obedience is requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed; for God hath not given them a coactive power to compell Chriſtians abſolutely, but it is lawfull for every Chriſtian to examine the life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Paſtors; and if he find them to be repugnant to Gods word, he may reſiſt them, contradict them, and if he have the Magiſtrates power he may depoſe them, or if he haue not, to depart from them.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114151:130"/>the doctrine of ſalvation, arrogating to themſelves a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering power over God himſelf.

               <p>Whence it appeares how much the Pope doth pervert divine order: He doth not acknowledge them for lawfull Princes, who bear the ſword by election or inheritance, unleſſe they receive inauguration from him; and if they obey not, he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates them, abſolves Subjects from the oath of allegiance, and commands to dethrone them, and if he can, he poyſoneth them; ſo that he hath made a meer ſlave of the ſupreme Architectonicall power; whom he accuſtometh not only at his beck to draw the ſword, as if he were his hangman, but alſo to come in an humble manner and kiſſe his feet. And on the contrary, he hath made himſelf and his Clergy the ſupreme powers; for firſt he hath exempted all Clergy-men from the Secular power, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſouls; Then, that he may ſatisfie that place in <hi>Paul,</hi> hath aſſumed to himſelf the ſword, though he be a Church-man, yea he carrieth two ſwords, ſo that now he muſt needs be the Supreme power armed with the ſword; and Chriſt (it ſeems) hath not ſaid, <hi>Kings bear rule, it ſhall not be ſo with you Church-men;</hi> but contrarily, <hi>Church-men bear rule, it ſhall not be ſo with you Kings.</hi> Theſe are the myſteries of <hi>old Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The new <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt delights himſelfe exceedingly in the ſame fable, and indirectly goeth about to renew it; for firſt he endevoureth to preſcribe to ſecular Magiſtrates, what civil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they are to appoint, and on whom to conferre them; if this be not done, at his pleaſure hee reviles them in private and publick, and ſtirs up the people againſt them.</p>
               <p>Then in all this work hee maintaines, that church-men in the affairs and formalities of the Church, are not ſubject to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but are immediately under Chriſt, ſo that church-men have an abſolute power <hi>of calling, making lawes, and executing eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick penalties,</hi> in which the Magiſtrate indeed may cumulatively help them, but no wayes hinder them, or do any thing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay not enquire with an intent to hinder or change them, or doe any thing of themſelves, except they will bee accounted ſacrilegious; whence it appears that the ſupream power of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:114151:130"/>ſword, given to Magiſtrates by <hi>Paul,</hi> is very ſhort, having loſt the command over Clergie-men ſo long as they meddle with Church-affaires, for then the Magiſtrares (as ſheep) muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Church-Paſtors: Perhaps the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> will ſay, that they are ſubject, but onely by reaſon of ſome ſecular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in their Church-government, which the Government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want. But the anſwer is eaſie, that the power of the ſword in Church-affaires is now become very poore and weake, ſeeing it conſiſts onely in circumſtances, when as on the contrary the Eccleſiaſtick power is ſubſtantiall in Eccleſiaſtick matters: and becauſe there is nothing ſo fecular, which in ſome ſort doth not belong to the Eccleſiaſtick Court; if then Eccleſiaſtick power is every where ſubſtantiall, who ſeeth not that this is much more ſupreme then the civill? becauſe that meddles with ſubſtances, this a meere accident, handleth onely accidents and ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſo that we may wonder what <hi>Paul</hi> meant if he knew theſe myſteries, in not aſcribing this ſupreme power rather to Church-men then to Magiſtrates. This the <hi>Walachrian</hi> learned not out of the Apoſtles, but out of the Popes Schoole, and if he be imployed by him to make a combuſtion in our native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by this new Popery, let him looke to be well rewarded by this his rich Maſter.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2</note> There is alſo a notable place of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> for the civill power in Church-matters, but becauſe I have largely handled this elſewhere, I will now leave its Elogies, and will examine the practiſe to wit what godly Magiſtrates have under the Old and New Teſtament done in Church-buſineſſe: we will find that there is now nothing among the <hi>Walachrian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Church-matters, and ſacred things of ſpeciall right, which have not been cared for by godly Magiſtrates, and immediately performed by them.</p>
               <p>The moſt holy worke of the whole Church-Government, is <hi>the reading of holie Scripture,</hi> becauſe then we go into the holy of holies, and conſult with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> But becauſe the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> is guilty to himſelfe that he handleth the Scripture baſely, and as Jeſuites uſe to make a noſe of wax, and a Lesbian-Rule, for he takes more delight in reading of <hi>Spalato, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Thomas, Cajetan,</hi> and other triflers: hence he placeth not much ſpeciall priviledge in this matter, but leaves it for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114151:131"/>and hee would thinke that it did not conſiſt with his honour and authoritative power if he ſhould ſtand in the Readers place and read the Scripture to the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Vocation is with him of greater account, which is his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of holies, and the ſpring of all ſpeciall priviledge; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee will have this handled warily, and will have great care taken that this fountaine of holineſſe bee not polluted by the touch of ſecular men; yet becauſe hee ſaw, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will by the grant of godly Divines, the right of electing and approving of Miniſters, now for a long time doth belong to Magiſtrates, in which election the forme of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation properly conſiſteth: that hee may not ſeeme to bee driven out of this lurking hole of his fained Sanctity, he hath ſo narrowly contracted that forme of <hi>Vocation,</hi> that hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it onely and properly in <hi>confirmation,</hi> that is, in <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands,</hi> which hee hath learned of old Papiſts: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now uſe hath prevailed, that Preachers onely ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hands, that is, imprint the character of Vocation and ſpeciall Sanctity, hee thinkes that it goeth well now with his ſuperlative holineſſe, in that onely Preachers are to imprint this character by impoſing of hands, and that only upon Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; hence hee is aſſured that the Sanctity of ſuperlative ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe conſiſteth in Preachers only, and in them onely ſhould remaine: hee grants indeed elſewhere, when hee ſpeakes of the right of deciſion in Synods, that it hath ſome ſhew of Vocation, when a private man (by the tacite conſent of the Synod or Church) is admitted to ſuffrages: But theſe are onely ſpurious Vocations that is onely holy, which makes one a Preacher by confirmation and Impoſition of hands: let us then ſee what godly Magiſtrates in the Old Teſtament could do in this point.</p>
               <p>The moſt notable confirmation and auguration above the reſt, is that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> when he was made high Prieſt, but this was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Magiſtrate at the command of God: For he put <hi>Aarons</hi> robes upon him, and anointed him, and when hee was to die upon the mountaine hee tooke off his robes and put them upon his ſon <hi>Eleazar.</hi> I know hee will ſay here, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Prophet, and an extraordinary man, but this is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114151:131"/>thing: for however God, we ſee, performed this notable work of Eccleſiaſtick confirmation by the Magiſtrate. Hence we may conclude, God never thought that Eccleſiaſtick callings ſhould bee ordinary and holy, and that Conſecrations ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Church-men onely, for this had been all one, as if God ſhould make a law for chaſtity and wedlock, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin himſelfe from Whoredome and Adultery, there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many famous <hi>Levites</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> by whom hee might have performed this worke if there had been ſo much holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it.</p>
               <p>Such is recorded by <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 16.22.</note> when hee appointed orders and turnes for the Prieſts in their ſervice, it was common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for all to performe this divine ſervice; but to doe it on this day, or after this manner, it was a particular right and duty, though this then was a meere Eccleſiaſtick buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Eccleſiaſtick men, yet <hi>David</hi> a ſecular Prince perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and did not grant it to the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>That act of <hi>Solomon</hi> is more illuſtrous,
<note place="margin">1 king. 2, 27.35.</note> when he thruſt <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> from the Prieſtood, and by his owne authority ſet up <hi>Zadok</hi> in his ſtead. Here the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> being put to a non-plus, flies to the help of petty diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>He ſaith,
<note place="margin">par. 1 p. 84</note> that <hi>Solomon</hi> did not properly depoſe <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Prieſthood; for, by his Divinity, hee had been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious. But, what then? he only baniſhed him, which ſecular puniſhment alone the ſecular Prince could inflict, by which means the Prieſthood became void caſually.</p>
               <p>Surely now <hi>Apollonius</hi> deſerves to plead for thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: if one be accuſed for murther, the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Philoſophie will deny that there was any ſuch thing done. What then? on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee thruſt his ſword into his breaſt, and ſo pierced firſt the skin, then the muſcles, and at laſt opened the greater veines, and then caſually the life fled away with the blood. Or if a thiefe bee accuſed for ſtealing of money, and ſhould deny it ſtoutly, hee will ſay, that principally he onely carried away the purſe, that he neither ſaw nor touched money: that he gave the purſe ſecondarily to another; and thirdly the purſe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and conſequently the money taken away.

I doe not thinke that <hi>Apollonius</hi> will bee ſo ſenſleſſe, if he bee baniſhed by the Magiſtrate, that he may not any more make tumults, and ſtirre up the people to ſedition: But he will thinke, that by this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he is thruſt from his holy preaching charge at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi> if he had not a Swines ſoule, or if it were not his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to delude the Scriptures, hee might have eaſily ſeen his foolerie out of the very Text: For, the place ſheweth, that the puniſhment which <hi>Solomon</hi> would inflict upon <hi>Abiathar</hi> was not properly baniſhment, for this was rather a benefit hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, for hee ſaid, <hi>thou art a dead man, but I will not ſlay thee:</hi> he had deſerved this puniſhment which he remitted, and ſhewed mercy in baniſhing him. What was then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly which hee inflicted upon <hi>Abiathar?</hi> To wit this in depoſing him from the Prieſthood; for the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, in expreſſe termes, <hi>thus Solomon caſt out Abiathar, that he might not be the Lords Prieſt;</hi> by which it plainely appeares, that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> intended and did that which this night-bird ſaith hee did not, nor could do: beſides the Hiſtory adds, that <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>Zadok</hi> high Prieſt; and becauſe he did all this, whilſt the Prieſthood ſtood by himſelfe, without taking advice of the Prieſts, ſurely <hi>Solomon</hi> in ſo doing was very ſacrilegious, or elſe the <hi>Stiltwalker</hi> is a cheating Divine.</p>
               <p>The ſpeciall priviledge of holineſſe is placed in <hi>prayer and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preaching:</hi> And becauſe this authoritative ſanctity conſiſteth in a circumſtance, <hi>in that theſe are done publikely,</hi> it is to be wiſhed, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> would declare out of the cabinet of his abſtruſe Divinity, what properly it is, to pray publikely: whether onely in the Church and pulpit, or not alſo at a table, in a ſhip, in in the ſtreet, in the market-place, in a chamber, as <hi>Paul</hi> did? If he ſhould unfold that exactly, yet I will ſay, that pious Princes have prayed and preached in publike.</p>
               <p>So did <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount,
<note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> held up his armes.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Joſias</hi> ſtanding in the Temple,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 34.31.</note> read and preached to the people.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reſtored religion, not onely <hi>Heſdras</hi> and the Levites, but <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Nobles read, and publikely ſpoke to the people. So that here are no footſteps of ſpeciall ſanctity in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, from which Magiſtrates are prohibited.</p>
               <p>At firſt there was a right of adminiſtring the Sacraments common and promiſcuous to all maſters of families; and when they had been a long time omitted in the deſart, the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing them was given to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> a Magiſtrate,
<note place="margin">Ioſh. 5. 2 Chron. 35.</note> and afterward to King <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> by God.</p>
               <p>The power of making Lawes concerning things indifferent in Religion, <hi>David</hi> and other Kings undertooke, though the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were preſent,</p>
               <p>The taking up of controverſies was in the power of ſecular as well as of Church-men,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> as appeareth by <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where plainly there is joyned with the high Prieſt a ſecular Judge.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> gave Lay-Judges of controverſies to all Cities, not making any mention of Levites. At <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> he ſet up the chiefe Tribunall, which conſiſted of Law-men and Clergie-men. The <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> concludes, that the Eccleſiaſtick Tribunall under <hi>Amarias</hi> the high Prieſt, in the matters of the Lord; was diſtinct from the ſecular under <hi>Sebadia</hi> his predeceſſour,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19.</note> in the Kings bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: but this collection is not certain; for, preſently to <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> are ſubjoyned the Levites: ſo that we can ſee nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from thinking it to be the Sanhedrim of Magiſtrates and Prieſts, in which the high Prieſt was to handle Eccleſiaſtick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters principally, and <hi>Schadia</hi> ſecular; but ſo that the ſentence ſhould be pronounced by the conſent of both. The Laitie then were never ſecluded from Eccleſiaſtick controverſies, but ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>The ordinary power of puniſhing was in the Magiſtrate; even for Eccleſiaſtick offences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people ſinned by idolatry: <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prince commands to ſlay three thouſand Levites. <hi>Achan</hi> ſtole the holy things, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> puniſhed him. <hi>Jehu</hi> ſlew the Prieſts of <hi>Baal, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> depoſed the high Prieſt <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and ſo oftentimes Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114151:134"/>have puniſhed Eccleſiaſticall perſons for Eccleſiaſtick offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or els have defended them from the unjuſt ordinances of Church-men.</p>
               <p>The fact of <hi>Ieremie</hi> is memorable, who being accuſed by the Prieſts for preaching, was defended by the Princes: And although the Prieſts endeavoured ſeditiouſly and unjuſtly to murder him: Yet <hi>Ahiacam</hi> the Prince reſiſted,
<note place="margin">Jer. 26.</note> and delivered the Prophet from the unjuſt judgement of wicked Clergie-men; who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is commended for it, and after the captivity is left in ſtead of a chiefe Ruler among the remainders of the Iſraelites: whence it appeares, that then there was nothing in all the Church-government in the old Teſtament of any ſpeciall right, or not to be touched by Magiſtrates; from the ſeparation of which notwithſtanding the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> borrowes his ſeparated right, as if all had been Sacerdotall functions, and entrings into the holy of holies, which had been ridiculous to the very old Levites.</p>
               <p>It remaines that we look into the new Teſtament, what the Magiſtrates did there.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Walachrian</hi> ſings the triumph; and thinks that the Magiſtrate had no power, becauſe he ſaith there were none in the Apoſtles time: whence he concludes, that the Magiſtrate is <hi>a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accident of the Church;</hi> and that non-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> have no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or right and operations.</p>
               <p>I anſwered before, that the Church was ſo farre from wanting Magiſtrates, or ſupreme power at that time, that on the contrary it reſided in Chriſt, and in his Apoſtles, who indeed uſed not that earthly pomp, but yet by their word they miraculouſly effected that which Magiſtrates did by their ſword; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that this power was corporall, or ſupreme over bodies, becauſe it was uſed by Eccleſiaſtick perſons miraculouſly, and not in any ordinary way, is as much as if you would ſay, that to kill as <hi>Phineas</hi> did, is not to kill, becauſe hee being a Prieſt, did it extraordinarily. I do not think the <hi>Stilt-wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was ignorant of this; but hee is angry, becauſe that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was then in the Church, and among Church-rulers, but is not without the Church, and among Magiſtrates. Hee had rather it ſhould continue within the Church: for all that hee intends is, to hurt and diſgrace any man by direct, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114151:134"/>courſes: But if hee will have the ſame ſupreme power which was in the APOSTLES, CHRISTS Legates, to remaine, hee ſhould by ſome ſure token let us ſee, that the ſame gifts are in him, which were in them; but being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſuch, he doth all one, as if he did brag of <hi>Croeſus</hi> his wealth, and yet is poorer then <hi>Irus,</hi> not having ſcarce a penny to buy himſelf a halter. It is familiar with him to imitate the Pope his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, he drove Magiſtrates out of the Church, &amp; ſnatching the ſword from them, tooke to himſelfe both the Secular and Eccleſiaſtic ſword. If by this gulfe he ſwallow the Magiſtrates, eſpecially the prudent Middleburgeans, that being in diſcord by his devices, they let go the civill helme of the Church, and commit it to this Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he will be to us a great <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the wonder of the world. This, I hope, I ſpeake not without reaſon; But ſecondly, I anſwer, it is moſt falſe, that there were no Magiſtrates under the Apoſtles, who by the Civill power defended and guided the Church, either without or within. This the <hi>Rattle-mouſe</hi> dreamed to be out of all doubt, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> and other ſupreame Magiſtrates were without, and the Churches enemies. What then, were there no chief rulers of an inferiour rank, who favoured the Church? he is as much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as if he ſhould ſay, that our Chmmon-wealth of the Vnited Provinces had not in the beginning any lawfull Princes, becauſe the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and his bloody Councell were their enemies. For the leſser Governours, to wit, the Nobles and the Cities, that is, the States, endowed with juſt power, under the government of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> did happily begin their buſineſs of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and liberty. So there were then leſser Magiſtrates in the Church under the Apoſtles, ſuch as <hi>Cornel us</hi> the Centurion, the Goaler, <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Pro-conſul, <hi>Eraſtus</hi> the Treaſurer at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Narciſſus, Nero</hi> his Chamberlain, whom the holy Ghoſt hath recorded, and doubtleſs many whom he hath not recorded. Shall we not beleeve, that theſe men prudently uſed their power &amp; eſtates alſo to defend the Church, if they had not done ſo, and had not been members of the Church? they would not have beſtowed their gifts for the common benefit of the body of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now to place all theſe without the Church, is to place the Sunne out of the world. Surely the Church-government under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was ſo popular, that the whole body of the Church was preſent
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114151:135"/>promiſcuouſly at the famous acts of calling and law-making:
<note place="margin">Act. 16. Act. 15.</note> the <hi>Walachrian</hi> then is a prepoſterous practice, in thinking that there Magiſtrates were excluded from Church-buſineſs, except he will ſay, that they were of meaner condition then women, and could not doe that, which women could then, or that they ſhould lay aſide their ſupream right, as ſoone as they came into the Church. All which fictions agree wel with the Popes inſtitution, who accuſtomed the Emperours, when they came to him the head of the Church, to lay downe their Crownes and Sword, to kneele on the ground, and to kiſs his foot, which comedie doubtleſs is very pleaſant to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian new Papiſt; but this grieves him, that he hath as yet a large ſea to ſaile over, before he can arrive to that harbour. I ſay, that all theſe Chymeraes were unknown to the Apoſtles, and that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Magiſtrates as Magiſtrates to be preſent at ſacred meetings, and to deliberate in ſacred buſineſs, and conſequently, that there were Civill Magiſtrates then in the Church.</p>
               <p>I adde, thirdly, that among Church-offices, there were ſuch, who though they were not Preachers, and Paſtors of the Church, yet had a government in it,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28.</note> for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that among the offices of the Church, there were Governours, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Preſidents or Biſhops: Which offices, becauſe they were ſeparated from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall government of the Apoſtles, it is not to be doubted, but that they conſiſted in the ſpeciall power of cenſuring and curbing of Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> againſt Ataxie, and alſe of defending the Church. Whom therefore <hi>Aretius</hi> thinks were Laics, who had inſpection over mens manners,
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. c. 20.</note> and diſcharged the office of Magiſtracie. So <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that there were grave men who had charge of manners, <hi>which is all one with the Civill power, that under theſe may be commended every kind of juſt government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I will prove by a neceſsary reaſon, that there were then in the Church who judged of ſecular matters, that is, were Magiſtrates. For we know out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. that there were among Chriſtians, controverſies about ſecular buſineſs: Hence I neceſsarily collect, that their Judges were either within or without the Church. If they were without onely, then the Corinthians did well in going to them, or elſe they muſt have left them ſtill unjudged. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is repugnant to <hi>Pauls</hi> reprehenſion, the latter to equity and reaſon. Hence neceſsarily it followes, that within the Church
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114151:135"/>there were ſuch as decided controverſies, or might have deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; and I pray what elſe were theſe, but ſuch as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates at this day? So that here I hold this <hi>Walachrian</hi> Batt by both his wings faſtned with ten-peny nailes to the doores of his Church, where having diſcovered his deformity, he may ſpend his dayes in biting and chirping.</p>
               <p>But what if it were as certaine, as the <hi>Walachrian</hi> would have it, that there were not Civill Magiſtrates under the Apoſtles, and conſequently, that then there were no right and operations of non-entities, how will his Logick prove that it muſt be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually? except he will perſwade us that Magiſtrates ſhould be alwayes infidels, and enemies of the Church, becauſe they were ſuch under the Apoſtles; which aſsertion were impious and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and contrary to experience. For three hundred years after Chriſt, Emperours as it was fore-told, <hi>kiſſed the Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> were made the Churches nurſing Fathers and Patrons, as it was apparent in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and others. Whence we ſee the <hi>Stilt-walkers</hi> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for he diſputes no other wayes, then if I ſhould ſay of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> ſo long as he was a beaſt, he was unfit for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore had no command in his Kingdome. Hence I ſhould collect that this was perpetuall, and that he never had his Kingdome againe; whereas we know, that as ſoone as he was reſtored to his reaſon, he was alſo reſtored to his kingdome and honour, and betooke himſelfe to his ancient government: or if a Maſter of a Family ſhould be unfit to rule his houſe, becauſe he is diſtracted in minde, ſo that he muſt guide it by ſome other: but if he recover his health, who will ſay that he muſt not return to guide his family again? This is the intent of theſe <hi>Walachrian</hi> Sophiſters, becauſe impious Magiſtrates were ſometimes mad, and unfit Fathers to guide the family of Chriſts Church, that therefore now they are ſtill unfit, although they be reſtored to their wits: and albeit that God hath honoured them with faith, piety, knowledge, prudence, and all other gifts fit for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they muſt be accounted mad ſtill, and muſt be kept out of the Church, bound faſt in Bedlam, that theſe unnaturall ſons alone might rule as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I will rather thus reaſon, becauſe Magiſtrates did not in the Apoſtles time rule the Church, (which they alwayes ſhould have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114151:136"/>done, by Gods owne inſtitution) becauſe they were Infidels, and enemies, therefore now they are bound to rule her, in that now they are made by faith tutors and nurſing fathers of the Church. This is all one as if we ſhould ſay of the Iſraelites, that they muſt never uſe husbandry and mechanicall trades, becauſe God for 40 yeares together ſent them Manna from heaven, and kept their utenſils from wearing, ſo that neither their clothes nor ſhooes were worne, for experience taught the contrary. And although perhaps many would have been well content to have been idle, and to enjoy that benefit ſtill; yet as ſoone as they went over Jordan,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 5.</note> Manna failed them, and their utenſils began to weare, whence they were forced to returne to their agriculture and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick trades. I will then hence inferre, ſince Magiſtrates are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, they are to be admitted into the whole ancient right, which out of the Old Teſtament we have ſhewed what that was. So that there is now nothing in the whole Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is not lawfull to them by Divine right, both for matter of action, rule and care. This is not my opinion alone, but <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe every where infinuates this in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although Chriſt would not have the beginnings of his Kingdome to be helped by the ſword,
<note place="margin">Com. in Deut. 13.5.</note> &amp;c. yet he had not preſcribed to himſelfe an eternall law; but at laſt he forced Kings to obey him, &amp;c. and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, made them keepers and patrons of the Church. Magiſtrates at firſt exerciſed tyrannie againſt the Church, becauſe the time was not yet come that they ſhould kiſſe the Sonne of God, and having laid aſide all violence, ſhould become nurſing fathers of her whom they perſecuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Commentarie upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. he ſaith, that Magiſtracie in the Church is as the earth, by whoſe fertility as the corne is procreated, ſo by the Magiſtrates office the Church is nouriſhed. In his Comment. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. ſaith, that by this command of Chriſt, we ſee the Anabaptiſts fury in excluding Magiſtrates from the Church of God, <hi>for it may be, that he who was Lord of a towne or village, might alſo in caſe of neceſsity performe the function of a Teacher.</hi> It is then plaine, that this man was of a far other opinion then the <hi>Walachrians,</hi> who under pretence of hoſtility exerciſed by <hi>Nero</hi> in the Apoſtles time againſt the Church, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114151:136"/>to debar Magiſtrates for ever from medling with Church-buſineſs. This was the cunning of growing Antichriſt, to keep off Magiſtrates from Church-affaires, as being holy, and not to be touched; ſo that like another <hi>Aeolus</hi> he ſwaggers alone in the Church court. Neither have there been wanting at all times, ſome Hermaphrodites, halfe men, ſoft and effeminate Princes, who with <hi>Sardanopalus</hi> laying aſide all their maſculine vigour, have ſubmitted themſelves to Eccleſiaſtick whores. Such was among the reſt <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, who wrote to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was unlawfull for any man who was not in the catalogue of holy Biſhops, to meddle with Church queries.</hi> But much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly <hi>Baſilius</hi> the Emperour, who in the 8. Synod ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That no Laey-man of what dignity ſoever ought to move queſtions in Church-matters; this belongs to the Patriarchs, Biſhops and Prieſts, who have power to bind, and have the Church keyes, and not to us who are to be fed, and ſtand in need of looſing.</hi> Theſe words, as if they were golden and pleaſing to the Popes pride, are oftentimes ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Jeſuites; and the Stilt-walker out of them,
<note place="margin">part. 1. p. 265, 266.</note> as if they were very notable, doth every where repeat them: for this is properly his intent, to ſtrike a ſuperſtitious feare in Magiſtrates, that they may abſtain from the Church-government, that he and his may the more freely domineere, and uſe Papall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
               <p>Yet there have been now and then famous and generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who by their maſculine carriage have curbed theſe whores, and made them betake themſelves to their diſtaffes, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> by preſcribing Lawes to them, and forbidding them the priviledge of caling. Among others, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who had well deſerved of the Civill Law; about the yeare 500. he made divers Lawes concerning the election of Popes, by which he commanded the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſhould not think of calling a Pope, except they paid a ſumme of money, and ſhould by way of Petition, ask leave of him to chooſe: Such an order was preſcribed to <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great by <hi>Mauritius;</hi> but he being murthered with his ſons by <hi>Phocas</hi> about the yeare 600. gave occaſion to <hi>Boniface</hi> the third to become Antichriſt, who then was firſt called, and held the head of the Church. Then the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114151:137"/>Empire ſtrugled to get out, and the Popes licentiouſneſs increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, untill after the 800. yeare it was again repreſsed by <hi>Charles,</hi> as appears by the Inſtitutes of <hi>Ludovicus Pius, Otho,</hi> and others, concerning this matter; but chiefly about the yeare 1070. <hi>Henry</hi> the third Emperour, a generous Prince, cauſed the people and Clergie of <hi>Rome</hi> to take an oath, that they would never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meddle with electing the Pope, untill firſt they had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned leave of the Emperour, which law within ten yeares after Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> did utterly overthrow; bringing his ſonne <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the 4. unto ſubjection, whom he compelled at <hi>Canoſſa</hi> to come on his knees to him, as may be ſeen in <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There hath been alwayes ſtrange ſtubbornneſs in the Pope and Church-men in making of Lawes, and inflicting of puniſhments, by name ſpirituall, but indeed corporall, againſt which many times generous Princes have ſtrugled, untill by a fatall violence the Pope at laſt got the maſterie.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ambroſe</hi> firſt began to put in practice; who by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> of a Praetor was ſuddenly made a Biſhop, whom afterward he vexed very much with divers penitentiall inventions, that if the Emperour had not for the greater good of the Church endured it then, it might have given occaſion utterly to deſtroy the Church.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was more impudent, who durſt excommunicate the Emperour, by whom he was juſtly puniſhed. This boldneſs increaſed in <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> and others, ſo that they durſt reſiſt the Emperour to his face, as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> brags. Generous Princes at laſt loſt their vigour, in that they would not command theſe Church-witches to be brought to them in chaines, thruſt them from their Biſhopricks, puniſh them with exile and death. Laſtly, in that they did not rule all things in the Church-diſcipline accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their authority and will, when they ſaw how they were handled againſt Law and Juſtice. Beſides, their power laſted ſo long over the calling and decrees of Councels, that Church-men could doe nothing without their beck and Suffrages; and Princes were too blame, in that they did not curb by their authority, the in-bred ſtubbornneſs of contention in thoſe ſpirituall men, and did not interpoſe their judgement, in the moſt ſerious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Church and of Religion, ſlighting the infinite
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:114151:137"/>quarrells of Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites examples out of <hi>Brevic. Collat.</hi> that in <hi>Auſtines</hi> time there was a great queſtion between the Orthodox and the Donatiſts, which could not be compoſed by Divines, but at laſt was ended by <hi>Marcellinus</hi> notary, and Tribune to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the younger.</p>
               <p>The ſame reports out of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Socrat l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. c. 10.</note> that under <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, Divines had diſputed long concerning the controverſies of Religion, which could not be taken up by the Synods. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> then commanded that every one ſhould deliver to him the forme of his Religion, which being read and weighed, he prayed and at length choſe the Orthodox opinion, rejecting the reſt, and commanded that alone to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doubts of the credit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> for, how could he know (ſaith he) what <hi>Ceſar</hi> did in his cloſet? He thinks theſe things fell out upon the prayers of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> by chance, rather then by providence, for if he prayed to God (ſaith he) it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he would pardon him for putting his ſickle into other mens corne, in that he thruſted himſelf raſhly upon this Church buſineſs: So it is plaine, that the old Papiſts, and new Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrians ſpeak with one mouth, and play upon the ſame ſtrings.</p>
               <p>But I on the contrary, out of this conclude that this myſterie of iniquity was not knowne to thoſe famous and pious Princes, that they muſt doe nothing preciſely under pain of Sacriledge in eccleſiaſtick buſineſs. For had they underſtood that this was ſo ordained in Scripture, they had abſtained, and ſo many Pious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church with whom they lived, had not ſo eaſily granted this to them. But hiſtories tell us, that all contention about this aroſe from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was driven to this by his pride and antichriſtian fate. With whoſe arrogancie the <hi>Walachrian Stilt-walker</hi> itching now againe, hath publiſhed ſo many abſurdities, falſhoods and blaſphemies, againſt Pious Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: which I have hitherto touched, that I am glad to have got out of the dirty and thornie place of his fooleries. But that I am in the laſt place to ſhew the acuteneſs of his diſtinctions wherein he every where abounds, which though I have ſcattering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted: yet here as in an abridgement I will briefly point at:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:114151:138"/>for whilſt he counterfeits modeſty, he ſeems to beſtow bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the Magiſtrate power in Church buſineſs; but this he doth ſo inconſtantly and careleſly, that preſently he puts ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle or other by a petty diſtinction, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to have yeelded too much.</p>
               <p>Such is this above the reſt, that he grants leave to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to handle Church matters <hi>objectively,</hi> not <hi>formally:</hi> by which diſtinction he will eaſily obtain, that, if he hath done all Church-buſineſs, he hath done none, becauſe he hath done <hi>eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick</hi> things,
<note place="margin">par. 1. p. 91</note> but not <hi>eccleſiaſtickly,</hi> or as eccleſiaſtick. The vanity of which device conſiſts in this, that of a circumſtance and baſe accident he makes a forme, for he will have ſo great force and efficacie in modern vocation, chiefly among the <hi>Walachrians,</hi> that it introduceth a new form into a man, or as the Papiſts ſpeak, a <hi>new character</hi> which pierceth into the ſoule; ſo that one and the ſame thing being handled by a Magiſtrate, is not eccleſiaſtick, but being done by a Church-man, or one that is called, it is <hi>formally eccleſiaſtick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which difference ſeems no greater to me, then if one ſhould doe the ſame thing in a gown or in a cloak, in a long black Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines cloak, or in a ſcarlet and militarie coat. For ſo the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts play with this their formality, who being ſecure of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their ſpiritualitie, have very frequently this changing of gowns among them, that upon the changing of the gown, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſanctity is alſo changed. For it is not unuſuall, that he who is to day a Church-Cardinall, to morrow laying aſide this gown, and changing his habit, become a Secular Prince. So that ſome are Church-men in the morning, Secular-men after dinner: nor is the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> as yet ſo ſecure of his own holineſs, as to play ſo openly, eſpecially in the <hi>ſuperlative ſanctity,</hi> but in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative he uſeth the ſame bounty, when he calls Conſuls and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Elderſhip, who therefore muſt either in the ſame, or in another gown, be in the morning Aldermen, in the afternoon Church-men. He is ſo rigid in his preaching ſuperlative holineſs, that he will not impart it to proponents, although now they be half-men, but to them alone, on whom there hath been impoſition of hands, whence the authoritative and ſacramentall dignity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:114151:138"/>
               <p>I confeſſe this fiction is not without a beginning, and ſome ſhew alſo: for it is taken from the <hi>Levites,</hi> in whom there was an innate and genuine ſanctity by Gods Ordination; whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe this difference, that one and the ſame thing being touched or handled by a Levite it was holy in Prieſthood, by reaſon of the ſanctity of the perſon: but it was prophane being handled by him who was no Levite. So in thoſe firſt worke-men of the Arke and Tabernacle <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> whom God had filled with his Spirit, and dedicated for this worke: The ſame worke might have been done by others, as it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which worke had been <hi>objectively holy,</hi> but they were not done formally <hi>holily,</hi> that is by holy men, and for this work ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiah</hi> were. The <hi>Walachrian</hi> Legendary from this beginning tooke his fable, which we would confeſſe might have ſome ſhew, if he could himſelfe without laughter aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that modern Vocation, and chiefly his <hi>Walachrian</hi> had in it any divine thing, except the common inſtitution of Vocation, and the end; as for the manner, he knowes himſelfe that it is ſo worldly and carnall, that no other wayes is a cloak or gown bought in a Brokers ſhop of old ware, then there this ſpeciall right of ſanctity. So that if hee would lay aſide his diſſembling vizard, hee would ſay with <hi>Scevola</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> that hee wonders <hi>when one ſooth-ſayer ſees another, why hee doth not laugh;</hi> for, the office of ſooth-ſaying was of great authority and honour, and the ignorant people had a wonderfull opinion of it; but that moſt learned man knew well, that in the ſecrets of ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying there was no true ſoliditie, becauſe they collected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine trifles from the chatring, feeding, and flying of birds.</p>
               <p>Even ſo I am ſure that this <hi>Walachrian</hi> amongſt his fellowes (if hee may with freedome) will oftentimes laugh, for cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimple men with ſuch a fine fiction, that there is in his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wonderfull ſanctity which hee knowes himſelfe to bee none at all; or if there be any, it is ſpoiled with his evill devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So that oftentimes hee is not called who is beſt gifted, but whom favour and promiſes promote. Whence wee need not wonder that no ſpirituall effects at this day doe follow upon this Vocation and Impoſition of hands, but oftentimes carnall,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114151:139"/>as of pride nnd envy, ſurely hee ſeeks water in a pumaice-ſtone, who out of ſo prophane a Vocation doth hunt for ſpeciall ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and thinkes that it is introduced and infuſed into men. If in modern Vocation, and Impoſition of hands there were any thing like that expreſſe Ordination, or Leviticall ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ordained by Gods owne Law, or if it were any wayes to be compared to the ſpeciall calling of <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liab,</hi> or to that notable calling of the Apoſtles, which ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts and eminent ſanctitie either followed or went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then there might bee ſome ſhew of obtruding the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall right of ſanctity, although the Apoſtles had an humble opinion of their own authority and would not brag of it.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> But becauſe this calling wants all theſe gifts and prerogatives, and is deprived of them, by reaſon of the wicked fraud of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what elſe is this, then (as I ſaid) to boaſt of riches, by having a board full of painted money? Their Vocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath the outward forme of that Vocation which was in the Apoſtles time, though in many things corrupted; they have alſo Impoſition of hands after their manner, but although all things were done without fraud, lawfully, and as neare the Apoſtles manner as could bee, yet there were no certaine reaſon to inferre that they have ſpeciall and certaine ſanctity who have this calling, (as the <hi>Walachrian</hi> brags) becauſe there is not any ſpeciall promiſe extant in Scripture, <hi>that all who are called after this manner muſt bee holy in a ſpeciall manner;</hi> therefore it is folly and Superſtition to believe this ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe faith is Superſtition which hath not for it Gods expreſſe promiſe; and ſuppoſe God had promiſed that this ſhould bee, becauſe Gods promiſes are conditionall, to wit, if men doe not by their corrupt actions hinder his grace: hence it is, that Gods bounty at this day is many wayes hindred, that from the Vocation and modern Impoſition of hands, eſpecially the <hi>Walachrian,</hi> there can proceed no ſtore of ſpirituall gifts, much leſſe any permanent ſanctity of ſpeciall right, no more then health followes upon Popiſh breathing and annointing, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth. There is no Vocation then at this day ſo holy and lawfull, as to confer any ſpeciall priviledge of ſanctity, or make any man after a ſpeciall manner ſanctified and Eccleſiaſtick,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114151:139"/>but the whole right depends now from the gifts. So that there is a lawfull calling and right, for performing of all ſacred things, where God hath beſtowed gifts and aptitude, whatſoever the party be, whether Church-man, or Lay-man; modern voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confers nothing elſe but order and a power to perform theſe buſineſſes of divine worſhip, which may be done by any man who is fitted, but he that is called is bound to do it, becauſe he is hired: no otherwiſe then in a ſhip (which ſimile <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.) all promiſcuouſly may row if they will, or if there be need; but he that is the Boat-man, or is tyed to the lower ſeat, is bound torow by the Law, or becauſe he is hired;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5</note> which ſeems to be <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, who ſaith, that Biſhops who <hi>labour in the Word,</hi> that is, ſpend their whole life in thus labouring, are worthy of double honour; that is both of honour and profit, becauſe hee adds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne, for the Labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that <hi>Preſbyters</hi> are not ſo diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Paul,</hi> as if it were not lawfull for ſome to preach; for that is againſt the place, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. where he calls <hi>Preſbyters</hi> promiſcuouſly <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and bids them all feed the flock, which is properly to teach: both had then liberty to preach. But becauſe ſome did it freely, and according as their affaires would permit; but others againe ſpent their whole life in labouring, caſting away all ſecular buſineſſes, as the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Prophets did.</p>
               <p>Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they labour properly in the word.</hi> And by reaſon of this duty and office, they were not to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, or Poteſtative Kings (as the Papiſts prate) but, <hi>Oxen trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the Corn, and hired Labourers,</hi> to whom not only honour as to others, but profit alſo is due, that is, wages and maintenance out of the Publique purſe. Surely, now in modern vocations, all the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit ceaſe, with which the church did then abound, in Gods juſt judgment. So that if God were now willing to uſe his bounty, the vices of thoſe that are called would hinder him. Now then, there is almoſt nothing left of their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in the <hi>Walachrians</hi> intention, but reward, or a yearely ſtipend, whence it appeares, that Preachers have no ſpeciall right of ſanctity by their vocation but only that (leaving their ſecular affairs, which they are loath to do) they ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their whole life about divine worſhip
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114151:140"/>not as Princes, but as Mercenaries, who are hived by the States from whom they expect their wages. So that of their <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie</hi> worke, they have nothing to brag above other worthy Members of the Church, eſpecially the godly Magiſtrates. For they are as fooliſh, as if in an Army, the common ſouldiers who are hired to watch and ward and performe other military duties, ſhould brag againſt that Prince who hires them, or againſt thoſe Voluntiers who freely venture their lives, who are therefore more happy and worthy then others, becauſe they are not hired, but fight out of meere honour, and may, when they pleaſe, lay down the dangers and burthens of warfare. But this is ſufficient for the vanity of the firſt diſtinction.</p>
               <p>His other fiction he gathers out of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Schoolmens old traſh, that he may yet the more ſtoutly keepe off Magiſtrates, from touching his holy things. For if this which he ſeared bee evinced, that Magiſtrates or Lay-men can bee <hi>formally</hi> Church-men, as ſurely they are when they be choſen Elders; becauſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by the Apoſtles inſtitution were all Biſhops, Paſtors, and therfore Preachers:

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21.</note> that he may put in a cavill for his ſpeciall ſacred things, he affirmes, that whatſoever Magiſtrates doe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they do only <hi>[imperatively]</hi> not <hi>[elicitivelyly]</hi> in which deſtinction, as in moſt, he ſeemes to affect obſcurity of tearmes, that he might cheat with ſuch canvaſſe ware, country people cheaters with multitude of words and nimbleneſſe of hands, hide their trifles, and oftentimes cry out, <hi>Let not one Artificer confound another.</hi> If the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſhould cry this a hundreth times, yet he could not ſave his impoſtures from being ridiculous, which now I will in few words ſhew. If he underſtood his owne diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, this is his meaning, that Magiſtrates muſt not meddle with modern Church-buſineſſe <hi>[by themſelves]</hi> that is, they muſt not preach, pray publikely, adminiſter the Sacraments, call or doe the reſt Immediatly which with him is to do <hi>(elicitively)</hi> and properly <hi>[to doe]</hi> for this (he ſaith) to doe were a great ſacriledge in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. What then? the Magiſtrate can do all Church-matters <hi>[imperatively]</hi> that is, he can command Preachers, who are alone, ſpecially ſanctified, that they handle Church-matters diligently. For which purpoſe, he can heape benefices upon them, he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them will veverence as Fathers, and if they be quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114151:140"/>he may compell and puniſh them, but not by himſelfe, for this were ſacriledge, to touch thoſe annointed, except it be by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick perſons; and even in the caſe of Rebellion and Sedition Church-men ought to be Judges. This is that he meanes by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [<hi>imperatively</hi> &amp; <hi>elicitively</hi>] by which pleaſant deviſe, hee thinkes he hath obtained a meanes to delight Magiſtrates, with words and wind, and whereas he ſeemes to aſcribe much, yea all to them in Church-matters; yet, indeed, he gives them nothing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then I anſwer, this fiction is grounded on falſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and meer fables, as appeares by what is ſaid before, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpeciall ſanctity of Church-affaires, which wee cannot find to be ſuch as ſhould exclude any of the faithfull, or who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt from touching, or immediate handling of them, for all are of common right and ſanctity. Again, if any thing in Church government, were in a ſpeciall manner objectively holy at this day, there ſhould be now no medium to obtain this ſpecial divine right for performance of that ſacred buſineſſe: for no man is born with this right, as the Levites were of old; no man is ſent from Heaven, as the Apoſtles and Prophets were; no man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by divine calling, or confirmed by a ſpirituall impoſition of hands, conferring any extraordinary ſpirituall gifts, as of old un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles; but the whole modern vocation, in reſpect of the manner is purely humane and oftentimes abounds with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vices and fraudes: ſo that there is nothing more ſure, then that ſuch a vocation cannot make one ſpirituall and holy by ſpeciall right. For there ſhould be more in the effect, then was in the adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quare cauſe, and ſo of a bad tree ſhould come good fruit. Modern vocation doth nothing elſe, but only for orders ſake, tye one to his office of performing divine worſhip in ſuch a place. So that what others, who have the gifts may doe, as voluntary ſouldiers, he is alwayes bound to doe, as a Hireling. For which cauſe hee is by the States and Magiſtrates ſet down in the catalogue of Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And the treaſurer is commanded to reward him for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as a <hi>mercenary.</hi> To perſwade us that by this vocation a man is made <hi>[ſpirituall, holy, and in a ſpecial maner ſanctified]</hi> is like children to make us believe, that of chalk, clay, or ſand, loays, pies, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chpain can be made. For ſo they out of their infancie bable among themſelves, whom the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> truly imitates, when he would perſwade
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114151:141"/>ſwade the Engliſh and all Magiſtrates, as if they were Babies, that modern vocation is of ſuch eſſcacy, the contrary whereof, he and others who are thus ſpecially ſanctified, ſhew by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. So that now we ſee it is a meer fiction that Magiſtrates as ſuch, cannot <hi>elicitively</hi> by themſelves, properly and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe all the buſineſſe of their <hi>Church-government.</hi> For this they could do in the Old Teſtament; why then can they not do it as well in the New, in which the ceremoniall preciſeneſſe is taken away and all faithfull men are made truely holy, and ſanctified to be Prophets Prieſts, and Kings, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, and ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> doth openly confeſſe, <hi>that a Lay-Governour of a Place or Village may teach in caſe of neceſſity:</hi> wee ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before, out of the Law and inſtitution of Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the adminiſtration of the Sacraments was not of ſuch ſpeciall ſanctity, but that it was permitted to lay men: and the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> did adminiſter the ſupper among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without reſpect or preſence of any Biſhop, or Preacher, as appears out of <hi>Pauls</hi> narrative;
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> now if under the Apoſtles, there was no ſuch ſpeciall ſanctity of thoſe things, it is cleare, that that which the <hi>Walachrians</hi> obtrude, is either fictitious, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from Popery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other deviſe of this diſtinction is, that it affirmes, the Magiſtrate can do nothing in Church-matters properly, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, becauſe he doth nothing by himſelfe, or <hi>elicitively,</hi> but yet all things <hi>imperatively, and by others.</hi> For this he ſaith, <hi>is to do nothing,</hi> which truly is an elicitive fiction: for if this be true, then a Hammer, Saw, Plainer, and other tooles, doe properly make a ſtatue or hedge becauſe they properly touch the ſubject, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect, not the workman. Then <hi>David</hi> did nothing in murthering <hi>Vriah,</hi> becauſe the enemies did it by themſelves, and properly; <hi>Ioab</hi> by ſo ordering it, and <hi>David</hi> imperatively.

               </p>
               <p>There is a notable example of the building of the Temple by <hi>Salomon,</hi> in which we know the King did nothing <hi>by himſelfe, or elicitively,</hi> for hee was no Maſon, Carpenter, or any other trades-man. All theſe things he committed to the Maſter-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114151:141"/>and hirelings: he only commanded and directed Hence the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Divinity will conclude that <hi>Salomon</hi> did nothing properly or formally, but only the builders and mechanicks. But the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes the contrary, who doth not name thoſe in the building of the Temple, but the whole worke is aſcribed to <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was choſen of God to that purpoſe: ſo that hee is called the builder of the Temple, and every where it is called the Temple of <hi>Salomon.</hi> So we ſee that the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> ſcatters abroad meere fooleries, when by his ſpecious diſtinction he will perſwade us, that the Magiſtrate doth nothing in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe he doth all things <hi>imperatively,</hi> but nothing <hi>elci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively;</hi> that is, he did by his command, order, and coſt, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate doth at this day.</p>
               <p>His laſt deſtinction is altogether ſeraphical, and ſo ſubtill, that the Magiſtrate will never be able to breake this barre, but if he ſeeme to do things <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>elicitively,</hi> yet the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Divines will mock and hiſſe him out: for when he beleeves that he hath done ſomething in holy Church-government; becauſe it is a meere <hi>accident,</hi> they will ſay, that he hath not touched, yea that he cannot touch the ſubſtance of Church holy things, but to be converſant only in worldly circumſtances, and accidents, which fine fiction, fit indeed for <hi>Oedipus,</hi> doth for ever debarre Magiſtrates from Eccleſiaſtick holineſſe, and will alſo free the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Eccleſiaſtick from carnall, and civill circumſtances, except among the ſecular circumſtances, one ſhould prove very ſubſtantiall, which is the procurement of the Miniſters yearely ſtipend which comes ſo neare to Eccleſiaſtick ſubſtances, that it is of more worth then the ſubſtance of all ſanctities. The old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have long challenged this part of Spirituality to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they might have ſpirituall lands, revenues, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, by which art they have totally freed themſelves from the lay carnality,</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Papiſt, who ſees every thing, ſaw this alſo, that it was a baſe thing for ſuch ſpirituall men, to bee maintained by ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſecular money, Whereas chiefely they ſcrape together our of the Spirituall Tenths, what they beſtow
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114151:142"/>ſparingly on the maintenance of Miniſters. But Magiſtrates as yet have not been ſo ſpirituall, as to let goe the right of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, for they feare that ſeeing they are excluded from the whole ſubſtance of Eccleſiaſtick Government, by thoſe ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holy men, they ſhall be diveſted of all circumſtances, if that principall circumſtance be omitted. However the matter be, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this laſt fiction at firſt ſight, ſmells of the Popes forge.</p>
               <p>For they to maintaine their Idole of tranſubſtantiation, that the bread may not be eate up and vomited by dogs, or gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by rats, have found out the like fiction, to witt, that what ſoever it be they eat, there is nothing diminiſhed from the Sanctitie of the bread, becauſe they gnaw eat, and ſpue but bare accidents, and not the ſubſtance. One egge is not more like an other, then this new Walachrian papiſt is like the old one; who that he may the better preſerve the ſacred things of his Church government from the Majeſtrats profane touch affirmeth alſo, that whatſoever they can, or will doe in theſe ſanctified things, yet the dignity of Church facred miſteries, ſhal be never a whit leſſoned becauſe they never touch but the <hi>[acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and circumſtances]</hi> being debarred from mediſing with the ſubſtance. For my part, <hi>let like lips, have like lettice,</hi> I think it ſufficient that I have ſhewed all the fooleries of theſe diſtinctions, with which the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> every where plays in his ſacred things. He hath fully by his example proved that ignorance is very bold there is no queſtion ſo abſurd, but he if it come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his head, wil vent it for an oracle. That he may keep off godly Magiſtrates from his holy things, not onely doth hee for the moſt part uſe the example or wicked men, but elſe where hee openly affirmes, that a faithfull Magiſtrate [hath no power in regard of his dignity and office] over Eccleſiaſtic matters [which doth not equally belong to an Infidell, in regard of his Office] he ſhall perſwade wiſe men to believe this raſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, when hee perſwades them, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> had the ſame power to come out of his grave, whileſt he lay halfe rotten, which he had when after Chriſt had raiſed him, he ſtood up alive, or that a Dog hath as much right, who is turned into a Woolfe, to keepe the flock, as he that is naturally apt to keepe the ſheep, and is an enemy to the Woolfe, or that a blind man hath as much right to ſhew the way, as he who is quick-ſighted, and hath both his eyes.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:114151:142"/>
               <p>He doth ſo contemptuouſly mince the ineſtable giſt of faith and converſion, that hee makes it almoſt but a ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Magiſtrates, whereas in Scripture it is ſo deſcribed, as that it makes a blind man ſee, and of a Woolfe makes a Dog, that is, changeth as it were the whole man.</p>
               <p>He alſo many times cryes out, that the Church was happier under the croſſe, then now under Godly Magiſtrates; if they ſhould make their power <hi>[privative]</hi> not <hi>[cumulative]</hi> that is, if they ſhould hinder Miniſters from diſcharging their ſacred affaires by themſelves, which he chiefly meaneth of the power of the <hi>[keyes, of making Lawes, and of calling]</hi> for hee thinkes that this chiefly belongs to the Churches happineſſe, that Church men may freely call whom they pleaſe, preach what they liſt, make Lawes as they think good at laſt, cenſure when and whom they will. This he thinkes was abſolutely done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the croſſe, and becauſe hee perceives that Magiſtrates doe meddle with theſe affaires by reaſon of the fleſhly corruptions and ſins, which they obſerve are introduced in theſe things by Church-men. Hence ſurfeiting with this peace <hi>[like the dull Oxê in the Port, he wiſheth for a ſaddle, and with the Horſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to plough the ground]</hi> hee thinkes the Church was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier under the croſſe, when ſhe had no Magiſtrates, then now when ſhe hath ſuch. This I will confeſſe, if the Churches hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe conſiſts in this, that new Walachrian Papiſts domineere in her, as they pleaſe: but this is a childiſh happineſſe. For youths are glad, when in the abſence of their Parents, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the eſtate and Family as they will, and they wiſh it might be ſo ſtill, whereas things are never more unhappily managed in the family, then in ſuch a caſe: So that it is a Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, when things are in a confuſion <hi>[there is none at home, but the children,]</hi> How happy this Eccleſiaſticke ſelfe-government, is without the Magiſtrates inſpection, may bee ſeen in Popery, where the Magiſtrate being thruſt out, onely Church-men rule, but how happily? When there is nothing there except miſerable butcheries, both of bodies and ſoules. The Game was not much unlike this, which the ſpirituall king <hi>Becholtius</hi> played at <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſwelling there with as great
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:114151:143"/>pride as the Pope doth at <hi>Rome,</hi> who wanted nothing to make him happy but continuance: if the <hi>Stilt-walker</hi> thirſteth for this, he deſerveth to conſume away with deſpaire. Hee ſpeakes too freely of the Churches happineſſe under the croſſe; <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> thinkes it no trouble, to leane upon cuſhions ſtuffed with other mens bloud, and as they ſay [ſubdue <hi>Alexander</hi> at the Table] if hee had ſeene but a farre off the whips, roddes wounds, and tortures, all his courage would quickly be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted ſomewhat long upon this diſcourſe, not as if I diſliked the Worſhip of Chriſtians, or the lawfull Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but that I might ſhew the impudent fooler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For no godly Magiſtrate intends to overthrow the Churches true order, to defile the ſacred things of Religion, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; this were a madneſſe fit for Libertines &amp; Atheiſts, from which I am very averſe.</p>

I will briefly, according to my ability, ſhew by what meanes this Leproſie, and increaſing evill may be met with, leaſt the force of Religion be weakened by contempt, or by reaſon of too much reſpect given to the Clergie; Inſtead of Religion, we have ſuperſtition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe quickſands the Ship of <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> hath alwayes with much difficulty failed, ſo that comming too neer either of them, ſhe hath indangered her ſelf, or made ſhipwrack. This the care of the Magiſtrate may prevent in matters of Church Diſcipline, Laws, and Vocation.</p>
               <p>Let this be held ſure in the firſt place, that the Modern Church Duci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is of order, not of Divine right, properly, or ſpirituall, whoſe effects are none, except on them who are bewitched with ſuperſtitious perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or are moved with the reverence of the Order; but in others who are ſtubborn, it is no wayes effectuall, except by the Magiſtrates ſecular force, it be ſupported: for what had excommunication or diſcipline been, except under the Apoſtles miraculous force, and feare of puniſhment had curbed the refractory? this now paſſeth to the Magiſtrate, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way. At this day alſo, the order, cenſure, and diſcipline of the Church, had been nothing, if refractory and diſordered perſons were not contained by the awe of the Magiſtrate, and feare of the Sword. It had been an unworthy thing in the Church to have excluded the Apoſtles, in whom was the force of all government, they are guilty of the ſame error, who at this day would ſeparate the Magiſtrates Authority from the Church, which is indeed the foundation of all order and diſcipline; wherefore godly Magiſtrates ſhould be confident of this, that it is in their power, now to give vigour and life to Eccleſiaſtick order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; whence it belongs to them to preſcribe Laws in this, how, and on whom they are to be obſerved; that ſimple men may not raſhly be deluded with the falſe perſwaſion of ſanctity, or with the mercenary col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of holy Offices, or deniall thereof, mens mindes be diſquieted; or the holy things of Religion be profaned. This was ſurely the chiefe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and foundation of the Popes mighty power, and the baſe contempt of Princes, that hee armed himſelf with a power of cenſuring, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communitating, by reaſon of the careleſſeneſſe of ſimple Lay-men, and the ſuperſtitious gentleneſſe of Magiſtrates, to which the <hi>Wallachrian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendaries hope that they alſo will come, and ſo doe every where all the

So you ſhall by your ſupreame power bring to paſſe, that the malice of ill-minded Papiſts, ſhall not hurt the conſciences, fame, goods, and lives of godly men, and that the wicked perverſneſſe of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Incendiaries may never hinder the ſincere labours of godly Miniſters, in preſerving of Religion, promoting of mans ſalvation, and in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true order and decency of the Church, this benefit alſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, will be had by your preſence, that new Papiſts will be hindred from profaning the Supper, and all holy things: there is nothing more common among theſe Out-laws, then to preſcribe Laws of ſanctity to others, which they themſelves will ſcarce touch with one of their fingers.

               <p>Now I come to their Legiſlative power, and dependence, which as a moſt holy thing, the <hi>Wallachrian</hi> Papiſts will have free to themſelves, but I have ſhewed before that there is no divine right in them.

Neither doe we find that the Apoſtles made many Laws there or rigid or neceſſary, which might lay a yoke upon Chriſtians, and give occaſion to will-worſhip, but they did ſtoutly every where forbid ſuch, leaſt it ſhould be ſaid to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians what the falſ Apoſtles urged, 1 <hi>eate not,</hi> then <hi>taſte rot,</hi> laſtly, <hi>much not;</hi> Beſides the Apoſtolicall meetings were extraordinary, for the ſupreme power reſided in the Apoſtles miraculouſly, which ſhewed it ſelf when occaſion ſerved. Many were preſent who had the gifts of Propheſie, of Tongues, of Government, of diſcerning ſpirits: and a full meaſure of the Spirit, ſo that there was no need then of contentions and quarrells, for ſeeing all were moved by one holy Spirit, it was eaſie for the ſpirits of the Prophets, to be ſubject to the Prophets, and to agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hee that will compare to thoſe Divine meetings, the modern Conventicles of Papiſts, were as good compare the running together of Beares, Porters and Pedlers, to the aſſembly of the ſeven wiſe men of <hi>Greece. Nazianzen</hi> was not the firſt that obſerved, but experience of all times hath taught us, that the chiefe uſe of Clergy-mens, meetings, is to ſpend victualls, or by ſetling of one quarrell, to raiſe many more, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one thinks that he is Chriſts Legat, ſubject immediately to him, under no mans command, and full of the Holy Ghoſt.

Who will dreame this to be ſacriledge, if in calling of a Miniſter, Church-men ſhould deſire him who is moſt unfit, looking to their owne private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, who if they be ſtubborne, even to the Churches ruine; I ſay, who will thinke it, ſacriledge if the Magiſtrate uſe his authority in procuring betimes for the Church an able man?

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114151:147"/>when they will not flatter him in his pride; who will debarre the Magiſtrate from curbing ſuch a man with his authority, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him to ſubmit to Divine Ordination, that is, obey the ſecular Sword? not that he ſhould be ſtill thruſt out of his Miniſtery, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did, and ſome of our age. Many remedies may be againſt this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, ſo that there is no neceſſity alwayes to uſe deſperate remedies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deſperate diſeaſes. Firſt, let the fault be mended by ſome <hi>mulct,</hi> or penalty, not that ridiculous Church one, that the cenſurer ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in words, and the party cenſured ſhall ſatisfie with words againe, or laughter, but let the <hi>mulct bee pecuniary.</hi> which will vex the Church-mans ſoule; Let a command be laid upon the Treaſurer, to detaine ſome part of his yearly ſtipend, for neglecting his Miniſtery, and not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty; I know there is no Miniſter ſo ſpirituall, as will not feare this ſenſible penalty.</p>
               <p>There is a higher degree, which they ſay in Eccleſiaſtick Policy is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>Zeland,</hi> among their acts; that who, though upon juſt cauſe, ſhall ſtirre up any party in the Church againſt the Magiſtrate, he ſhall be ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from his Miniſtery in that place, and never to be admitted thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Let it not be amiſſe if they borrow a remedy from the Gentiles, even from the Pope himſelf, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of old did gold and wood from the Tyrians and Gentiles, for the building of his Temple.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> they had their <hi>Oſtraciſme</hi> and <hi>Petaliſme,</hi> by which they uſed to baniſh from their Cities for ten yeares together, not thoſe that were infamous, but whom the favour of the people made ſuſpected of affecting the tyranny. This baniſhment was not diſhonourable, nor perpetuall, for after the expiration of ten yeares they returned. This was the effect thereof, that by their long abſence they ceaſed to be burthenſome to the State, and leſſe feared. The like cuſtome at this day the pope or Biſhop uſeth, when hee ſeeth any man either for his vertue or prepoſterous zeale, or elſe for ſome tolerable fault to be any where ſuſpected, or burthenſome, he ſends him away to ſome other place, by a change not diſhonourable, that ſo the perſonall or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inconvenience may be avoyded without any great loſſe of honour or profit to him who is thus tranſlated. There are other remedies which may be found out by others to cure the heat of Eccleſiaſtick pride at this day; which if you will carefully prevent, by plucking up the cares of ſuperſtition, and papall tyranny, the corne of Religion and Order will continue pure, and free from all contempt: One perhaps will ſay; what ſhall be done, if a wicked Magiſtrate, and an enemy of the Church ſhould be endowed with ſuch power in Eccleſiaſtick matters? Will not ſuch
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114151:148"/>an exorbitant power prove deſtructive to the Church? Which will be prevented, if he be debarred from medling with holy things.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>Wee muſt not doe evill, that good may come,</hi> neither muſt mens mindes be filled with devices, that the Church may be kept from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Paul,</hi> as I have often ſaid, was not ignorant of this evill, and yet he injoynes every ſoule to bee ſubject to every Magiſtrate. Beſides, we muſt note that religion, hath been more ruined by too great Eccleſiaſtick, then by too great Secular power; ſo that this is alwayes an inteſtine and domeſtick deſtruction, that when neceſſity requires may be ſecluded. Let Papiſts, and chiefly Anabaptiſts witneſſe, amongſt whom the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Magiſtrate is the occaſion of infinite, and irreconcilable Schiſmes. This had alwayes been incident to <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> if the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power had not preſerved unity, and purity of Religion, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, under the Apoſtles, and after them, by the ordinary meanes, ſo that in the fulneſſe of Antichriſtianiſme, Religion was not extinguiſhed, untill the ſecular Sword was ſuppreſſed, and Church-tyranny had ſeized upon all. If it ſhould pleaſe God to afflict the Church with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſery, that our Magiſtrates ſhould prove impious and enemies to the Church; <hi>Apollonius</hi> his fictitious Hierarchicall Government, will prove but ſmall helpe againſt it, no more then childrens ſeed, which they ſow in their little Garden-plots, will reſiſt hunger, if the ground be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally barren, as it was in Aegypt: in ſuch a caſe we muſt pray to God, ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> that hee would turn the Magiſtrate; and wee muſt indure the affliction; and if Order and Government cannot be preciſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet by all meanes the purity of Religion muſt be maintained, as we ſee how little contention there was among Chriſtians for preheminence, command, and power, when they were under the croſſe, who rejoyced, if by any meanes they could preſerve the forme of Divine worſhip, and true Religion.</p>
